They're cute shorts but I read the reviews saying they run small. I'm a size 2 normally but I ordered an XL and they're extremely tiny! Don't fit at all!
END
Quality shirt. Fast shipping
END
So pretty and it shines like white gold! I Weight lift at least twice a week an none of the bars have even scratches it! Comfortable and high quality I'm in love!
END
Nice fit, very warm and a great look
END
love the look but this hat runs really small. no dude will be able to wear it.
END
I LOVE this bathing suit! The style, design, and size are perfect! The color has faded some, but I ordered another one because I love it so much.
END
Ordered a medium fits as expected lol
END
Very pretty, but if you have a medium to large breast, it doesn't fit right at all.
END
My son loved these cleats, however I must have missed that they were soccer cleats and not football cleats.  I missed the deadline to send them back :(
END
Cute but tiny
END
I love the idea and it looks like what I want, but the slit in the back is too high... just below my butt.  Had I sewn the slit even a little bit, I wouldn't be able to move in it.
END
Great idea for a wrap but the one size fits all is misleading you better be a size 10 or less for this to fit right and look cute.
END
This is a wonderful shirt but I wanted to put my two cents in, in regard to size, to help others. Normally I would have ordered a 3XL and that would have been slightly large. With this company, I ordered a 5XL and, while it is wearable, I can overlap the from and make a shorty-robe out of it. I think one size larger than your normal U.S.A. clothing should suffice. Again, I LOVE this shirt!!!
END
grandson loves it
END
Wretched garment!! ... good for the price because I was not surprised, but it's very tacky ... termination is not fine, I definitely will not use, nor buy anything more from this brand, I was disappointed. I bought it for an event but of course I did not use it, end up buying another garment. Disappointment, do not buy if you expect quality
END
Fast shipment on this item and good quality!
END
these run small - order a size up!  my 22 month old this summer wears a size 6 but after reading the reviews and recommendation to order a size up i did...and am glad because the 7 fits like her size 6 shoes.
END
I always have a pair of these in my rotation. Comfortable, especially in the summer. I'm a size 8 but these run a size bigger.
END
I loved the style of this outfit when I saw the photo and I was really excited to receive it. But once I got it it wasn't what I thought. I wish it had been made a little different. Overall not bad just would have bought somewhere else.
END
love, love, LOVE this purse!!! I was nervous about buying it but when it showed up I fell in love. it got to me pretty flattened but as soon as I flattened it and filled it it was just like the picture! What they don't tell you or show you is the gold "emblem" thing says Gucci in cursive. I know its a fake but still very cute!
END
Bought these as a gift.  She really likes it.
END
This is an extremely well made and beautiful piece! I was really pleasantly surprised with the weight and quality of it when it arrived. It was packaged nicely in a small gift box and arrived in perfect condition. I really like the royal blue lining in the box as it adds a nice pop of color when you open it. It also comes with a cleaning cloth which is a nice added bonus.  The disk itself is approximately 1" in diameter and the inscription is nice and deep so it can be easily read. The chain is a box chain which is very sturdy and the clasp works well. This isn't an overly feminine or masculine necklace, so I think you could give it to just about anyone.  Overall, the necklace and charm are shiny and beautiful! This would make a wonderful gift for a loved one in your life, especially for the reasonable price point! I received this product at a discount, however, my review is honest and unbiased.
END
I sent them back mainly because they were much smaller than the sizes shown on Amazon. I ordered a small according to measurements on Amazon, but they were much too small, wouldn't order less than a large, if I reordered. I didn't seem to think they looked very rugged. They were also made in China, which I assumed for the price, they were American made.  All this stuff comes from China at a fraction of the cost, but the savings is not passed along to the consumer.
END
My girlfriend loved them and it looks great and is well made was a good purchase and wasn't expensive at all
END
I purchased a 1x, and it was so tight I could barely get it off.  My sister wears a large and it fit her perfectly.
END
It's a bit big but just fits, however no issues with the quality, it top notch for what your buying. I love it but it's not a proper kilt, so just keep that when buying. It's awesome
END
Fits perfect!
END
Nice

We bought the coat as a Christmas present for my daughter. As other reviewers have stated, the coat proved to be very small for an advertised  medium size, consequently it not fit my daughter. We could return it but it would cost at least $35.00 to ship it back to China. It's just not worth the cost since we already have $83.00 invested in the purchase. We'll probably try to sell it to recover some of our investment.  We're very disappointed in the purchase. Amazon should post information with products like this that come from China stating the extra cost of returning products. The additional cost to return really negates the benefit of the merchant offering a return policy.
END
Good fit, very warm and I love the hood..
END
The shirt was like 5 bucks. Way better than I expected for 5 bucks but its not a $30 shirt so don't expect a $30 shirt. This feels like a $20 shirt and I love it.
END
Colors pretty accurate.
END
Love this ring!
END
I wasn't sure how this was going to fit but it's perfect! Just wish that it had a velcro strap instead of a tie.
END
Wanted this hat for good sun protection.  My baby's head is in the 50th percentile, 16" circumference at 4 months old. This hat in the infant size was huge! It almost fit my husband, who does have a small head but still is a grown adult.  Needed to return.  I ordered the newborn size instead and it was still a little big but fits great.  It also has some stretch on the sides so I expect it to fit for a while.  He looks like a little hunter in the bright orange.  Covers great.  My only complaint are the strings that dangle on the sides are difficult to tie under a chin, would be more helpful to have velcro. But this doesn't really matter too much.  Recommended, just make sure to order a smaller one than you think you need.
END
Very cute.  They last for longer they expected.
END
It's very see through so I'd recommend to get it if you have something under or over it to wear. I wear it worth my corsets so it's really cute especially the way it hangs. Very nice and cite pave.
END
The necktie is stretchy in the back with a clasp which is great for the kiddo. shirt fits perfectly!
END
very well made and looks just like it showed in the picture. cant wait for my grandaughter to wear it.
END
It is supposed to be a brown, looks like old vomit green.  Not even close to the photo color.  It's crap.  Yeah for me I get to make a trip to the UPS store because they liked.
END
These bracelets are the best.
END
I absolutely LOVE my Thinoptics I phone case with readers! This is more than an "eye"catching invention. I have been in countless situations where I didn't have my glasses...but I always have my phone. To be able to whip out these ThinOptics has been a blessing.  Everyone who sees them asks me about them, and I always tell them to check them out at Thinoptics.com. This is truly a worthy, needed product. Thank you! Mike

Love this gown
END
Comfortable and quality made.
END
shoe is too big for my 4 month old's lil feet!  will keep them for later when she gets older
END
Cute necklace for the price
END
Very nice quality
END
I purchased this top thinking it would be a US size 14 got it and it was more like a size 8 and I hope others read this review before purchase so, won't be dissatisfied like I am...
END
Nothing like the pic. Mid too low waist jeans. Very disappointed. They barely go over the back side.
END
gorgeous!!
END
I should of known being a international size.  It was an XL but fit like a xxs.  Very disappointed.
END
Nice sweatpants, fit as expected.
END
Not made very well
END
I love this shirt, but it's big (as in wide). I feel fat in it!!! Look at the freakin' picture!!! That skinny lady looks like she intentionally wants to be fat with this thing. But what the heck. I can alter it to fit my body better with the sewing machine... if only I could pull myself away from the computer for a long enough time between my bidding for creepy antique dolls on eBay.
END
Football or soccer?
END
I love this dress! It got well in me and I wore it to my friends birthday dinner recently and everyone complemented me on it and asked me if they can borrow it next time because they thought it was cute (: I love it
END
Somewhat small
END
barely any swelling, now they don 't hurt very much.
END
I'm 5'3 and 130 pounds... The shirt fits just right but is a little long... I usually like my shirts shorter, I just tie a knot in the front to shorten it.  Very basic shirt... Really thin material, what you expect for the price
END
one of my best buys
END
good price
END
I just got this. Not only was it affordable with free shipping, it's VERY beautiful! I love it!
END
loved it
END
These are cut shorter then other color version of the Volcom shorts I have. When not worn properly you will look like a nerd unless that is the effect you are seeking
END
We like this brand to have spirit shirts made, holds up well.
END
cheap lookin
END
This was a gift. Based on comments, I ordered what I thought would be best size to hang properly.  Receiver said it is WAY too big, and that even a medium might have been, as well.  As one who doesn't own this type of shirt, I didn't know if it is most important to fit through the shoulders, or not be too tight at the hip.  I'm bummed, because return/reorder will cause this gift to be too expensive.
END
High quality, amazing price. Really comfortable and it is high quality, just like everything Hanes
END
Cute and nice light comfortable material for an 18 month old little guy.
END
Color is very dull...not bright like it shows in the picture. It is very small...more like a child medium. Disappointed.
END
Too small.
END
Bought these for our son and the first time he wore them the string came off one of the gloves. Not attached well at all. They are tied in a knot looped through the fabric of the gloves. They really need to be sewn to the string for durability especially being they are meant for children. I would not recommend unless you plan to sew the string on your self.
END
wasn't what I expected
END
Great umbrella for kids. Light weight to hold, fun colorful and easy to manage. My little one loves having her own bubble umbrella. It really keeps you dry and holds up to the wind on a rainy day
END
Don't buy it, keep looking. Very cheap looking, the details by the collar look like they were glued on. No finishing touches. Looks like a dress from grandmas closet. Also the exchange and return policy is awful.
END
For the price the costume is great. It came in a better plastic bag than normal costumes so you can hang it in your closet. Boyfriend wore it for Halloween and looked awesome.
END
I was so excited to receive this t-shirt but the fit is awful! I ordered a small and while it fits in the arms, waist, etc...there is extra fabric near the chest/armpit areas that does not rest on the body and "pulls" across the shirt. This wasn't a case either of a woman wearing a man's t-shirt. I have worn many men's size small t-shirts without this problem. I requested a return and have yet to hear back.
END
Pretty comfortable, but if you live in a snowy or icy climate, you need treads on the bottom, or forget about wearing them. SUPER slippery on snow or ice...even just a fine dusting of snow and you'll be on your ass if you're not careful.
END
These are better than I thought they would be. Got these for my girlfriend and she loved them. Extremely soft and seems to be of a good quality material. Great colors and of course the design..lol The size was perfect, see pics... she told me what size to get her. These are functional and fun! I did receive this product at a discount from retail to try it out and review. If by chance you learned something or this helped your buying decision, please click that this review was helpful so I know the time put in reviewing actually does help people.
END
perfect for my granddaughter for overnight camp. hit over the knee. she is 8 years old and 52 or 53 inches tall. slender build.
END
I've never seen this in my life.
END
Really enjoy the belt. Looks great
END
The matching hankie and tie are wonderful. The shirt fits great.
END
These cords are AOK but I thought they came with the adjuster, to keep it snug to the head. The opening that slides over the ear piece is tight but that just might be a good thing.
END
My 15 year old daughter loves this necklace! It is a very beautiful necklace and good quality.
END
I gave this to my girl the day that it arrived, Tuesday, and by Friday the "pearl" had cracked.
END
I got a small and it ended up being too baggy and too short. When I lift my arms up, it shows my bra. I probably couldn't wear this in public. Waste of my money.
END
My daughter got this for her Dad for Christmas and he loved it.  Not sure that he will play it much but it is a very cute keepsake!!
END
I'm pregnant and pre-pregnancy normally wear a large, I ordered a large. It was too baggy at the top which is a rare case for me as I am pretty busty. I probably could have returned it for a medium but I decided to pass because the material was a bit cheap. I'm rating based on fit/material. The actual print and cut are really pretty. If the large fit how I hoped then I would have kept it and maybe rated it a 4.
END
I love these leggings!  Wear well, wash well, and not see through. Nice bold colors too. I've since bought another pair.
END
Too large. I had to return it.
END
I got this hat to protect myself from the sun while attending Coachella. In regards of the value of this hat, $20 for minimal to no sunburn was great. While the hat is now trashed and ripping, I'd attribute it to the fact that it was worn, stepped on, bent, and thrown around for 10+ hrs for 3 days straight. Great value. Love it.
END
I love how long they are.  I am 5-9 and they fit perfect.  I think they will be a great pant to travel in.  Very cute and great buy for the money.
END
Perfect
END
It will help me not to lose any more phone camera lenses.
END
Nice hat really cute
END
The outer shorts fit fairly well however the inner shorts are made for a weirder body than mine. They make the shorts pull in funny ways. Am considering cuttjng out the panty liner and just wearing the shorts.
END
Thin material. Does not flow well on the body. Very shapeless.
END

END
Beautiful piece!
END
I love this hat it covers her head and neck. Very lightweight material, but Uva protection.
END
Amazing, freaking adorable. Arrived exactly as pictured.
END
I had high hopes for these c-section panties, but was disappointed overall. C-sections are major surgery and recovery is a fairly uncomfortable process. I received disposable support panties while I was recovering at the hospital. I found the disposable hospital panties much more comfortable and practical than the c-panties. When I tried the c-panty on, I found the pressure it placed on my incision area to be painful and abrasive. Based on my experience, I would highly recommend saving your money and instead asking for extra disposable support panties before leaving the hospital. If necessary, the disposables can be hand washed and hung to dry to allow for more use during the recovery process.
END
My husband loved it!
END
Perfect for summer nights and gives you coverage.
END
These are adorable!!! I'm so glad we got these as a starter headband set!
END
I ordered this sandal for my granddaughter who have a chunky foot, and her mother said they fit fine.
END
As advertised, ended up returning it because it was too small, but I do have a big head.  Otherwise, As advertised
END
They look wonderful. the color is beautiful. It looks just like the photo. I would suggest this to anyone. i love it.
END
Love this dress, but size up! I ordered according to their size charts and this fit like a sausage casing.
END
Very sexy on me but the only thing too small..should've ordered one more size up,don't do much returning so I'll probably be giving it away
END
Cleats are great.  This is our second pair.  Light on the feet and comfortable.  Son is a lineman. !! Love them
END
I like the texture of these mitten. I have read about scratch incidents but never happened to us. Overall pretty happy with the products.
END
This took a long time to arrive because it was from China, but the description made this clear and it was worth the wait.  It's delightful, especially to wear with bronze jewelry.
END
returned it
END
I don't think that I've ever spent so much money on a t-shirt, but I'm glad that I did.  I bought this shirt specifically for hiking and backpacking.  Here's a list of what I love about this shirt: Fits, feels and looks like a normal cotton t-shirt, except that it's even more stylish (unlike all other technical tshirts that I own). It is odor resistant and moisture wicking.  It has reat thermal properties (keeps me warm when it's cold out, and cool when it's hot).  And lastly, have you ever put on a wet t-shirt?  It feels horrible, BUT not this woolly shirt.  It feels just as good soaking wet as it does dry...amazing.  One thing to think about: One day I pulled it out of a drawer, and found that bugs ate a couple holes in the collar :(.  So now, I store the shirt in a zip lock bag.  I hope that keeps the critters from munching on my most expensive t-shirt.
END
You need a small neck for this.
END
Super cute! I read the comments so I knew to size up. It's a very oversized look so  be prepared that it has the mannish shape so go up 2 sizes to give it the appropriate look. Very 80's. I wear it with pastels to really make it pop. Gotten to of compliments on it.
END
The price is good, but you need to know that for this price you are getting low quality socks made in china.
END
very nice, just like the picture, the size is nice perfect and is a great quality! do not include chain as described
END
Somewhat large until they were washed.  Good fit.
END
Good stuff...
END
I received this piece yesterday and I am so happy with it! Not too gaudy, but "nicer" than a plain bar. A great price, too, as even the piercing and tattoo shops in my area charge $15+ for much simpler bars.
END
I'm originally a 6 1/2 in womens sneakers so I thought to buy a 6 1/2 boys in these. I got them and realized they were super long. Putting them on, they left a giant space at the toes. But I guess that's my own mistake. I should've bought a size down
END
For some reason, the belts I buy all seem to have a short shelf life. Most of the belts I buy are in the 20-40 dollar range and yet they don't hold up very long, and they certainly feel cheap. This Buyreal belt is both durable and looks really good all while being in my price range. I can tell the materials are of quality and I fully expect this belt to outlast my others, I will report if anything changes, but you can expect this belt to survive prolonged everyday use, while being fashionable. Why is it so hard to get a quality belt these days? I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.
END
Loved this!
END
Liked the suit but ordered a large and it was too small and I weigh 130
END
I like the shoe but because my daughter is a preemie they are to big.
END
The chain is beautiful and durable. It's well-made out of excellent quality. I definitely recommend buying it!
END
Bear in mind that all MiracleSuits are supposed to fit tightly so your belly pounds seem to 'miraculously' disappear. In reality, they are somewhat sausaged. However, if you have owned the most expensive variety ($100-$150) of Miraclesuit, you won't be disappointed by this version made for a wholesale chain.
END
This ring was very poorly made. The two stones on each end were dull almost grey looking. I am returning.
END
Looks very nice.
END
This is a great dress!!!  For the price, it cannot be beat, it looks like an expensive dress!  I ordered a medium, I am a 34D and surprisingly the bust area was a little big, luckily the straps ARE adjustable.  I usually wear a medium in dresses (I have a fuller bottom) and this medium fits a tad bit larger than what I am typically used to.  I would say order your normal size and you will be fine!  Again, beautiful dress - looks exactly like the picture.
END
Very comfterble and the perfect streams
END
i bought 2 pair 1 for me i for my daughter. all we can say is breath taking..   now D-GEM i need garnet and ruby just like them please???
END
The dress arrived as stated. I order 3x this is 16 in US size. If I would have knew that I would not have waste my time. The arms were tight. If is pretty if you were 16.
END
Perfect gift for my husband who farts anywhere and everywhere.
END
Pretty true to size if not slightly bigger. Pink color as shown. Very easy to get on and off. Worked well for my 1 year old.
END
Super
END
The dress was a little small but I did expect a little difference than stated due to reading other reviews. The dress pattern and color were the same as pictured and fit is as described. I do love the design and as I am working on losing weight I hope to fit into it comfortably very soon!  DISCLOSURE~The Maker has provided me with this product discounted or free of charge for review and feedback based on my first-hand usage of the product.
END
Way too small.
END
Daughter loves them
END
Bad quality. Color looks nothing like in the picture. Had a weird smell.
END
I like it,but size 5 is to small for me why I ask size 5.5 for it's really very perfect,wish you have size 5.5 thanks
END
Band seemed nice and heavy (as opposed to light and cheap feeling) but the frame was entirely too big and the fitbit would not stay in place. Unfortunately had to return it and try another brand.
END
I like the fabric.  The shirt is not to size.  It is supposed to be a mans xxL it's more like a L.  I am afraid to see what happens when it gets washed.
END
I was looking for a A line dress for my Mom and this was perfect. Fabric was light and soft perfect for summer.
END
The shirt is cute, I normally wear a medium but I ordered a large. It fits me well although I am going to ping them on the collar. I know this shirt was very low in price but that collar just throws the whole shirt off!
END
meh... it's ok i guess.
END
Best shirt stays I have ever had.
END
We love the Netfix show Bloodline and when we went to the Florida Keys this summer, we visited many of the locations in the show. When we stopped by the Caribbean Club in Key Largo, we saw a man wearing a Rayburn for Sheriff shirt. We went online and found this shirt and without hesitation bought two of them. They are made of comfortable cotton and after washing retained its original size. I would recommend this shirt to any Bloodline fan.
END
I love this so much it's actually the second one we've purchased once LO grew out of the 3-6month size.  Allows us to minimize the amount of sunscreen we use by applying only to exposed areas.  Wish we could keep a hat on him for as well as this suit protects
END
she wears it
END
Earrings were broken.
END
I love these! At first look, I thought they'd be cheaply made. They are super soft and I get plenty of compliments. My 9 year old daughter took the 2nd one and wears it every day. Super cute for adult and kiddos
END
I like them. They're a snug fit all around.. In the front and the back. Separately, the felt a little small.
END
I rarely leave feedback on Amazon and was leery about buying outside US. Based on all the 5star reviews, I decided to purchase 2 of these. So glad I did!! Even prettier in person! Actual length end to end is 26 inches, then there is an additional 2 inch extender. From order date to delivery was only 11 days! Much faster than expected. I emailed the seller about shipping and got a response the next day. These are a great value and very bright and vibrant! Extremely satisfied! Thank You!
END
XML was a medium disapointed
END
Boy did I do a bad buying this. It's a little cheap little piece of nylon junk. Please don't waste your money.
END
I bought these sunglasses because i was looking for a good pair to wear around. i worn them three times already and they some how got a crack down the middle of them. its small enough not to notice but i really liked the sunglasses. I would recommend them for sure they are great sunglasses, i mean im going to continue to wear them until they fall completely apart.
END
wow this is made for a big giant hand it would not fit me I have small fingers and the girls real small my husband they did not even fit on them this was a waste of money
END
Good item for price.
END
Too thin for my lobes
END
This fit as I expected
END
Fast shipping, exactly as described. Looking forward to using!
END
Ordered this a couple days ago and just got it. The chain is good quality and weight. The charms are very pretty and nice! Looks just like the picture.
END
It fits great, don't go by your normal size use the size chart that they provide for you. They're a size chart is different than what you may normally use.
END
I did not like the way it fit me, so I tried returning it. That was in September, I have yet to get a refund. I had to spend more to return it than the shirt was worth. :(
END
This arrived early for me, its as the photograph which is great, this dress fitted well and the length was not to short, another happy purchases
END
Very itchy cheaply woven fabric.
END
This keeps breaking.
END
Is this order for 1 ring or 2? Is it each ring $8.99 or are both rings $8.99? (1 - $8.99) or (2 - $8.99)
END
I purchased this costume for my husband and it worked perfectly for the western-themed party we attended. It was comfortable to wear and looked really good on. For the most part, it is exactly as described in the description. The only difference is that the description doesn't mention that the white collar shown is actually attached to the vest. The vest runs a tad bit small, but I wouldn't suggest going up a size because the jacket itself is true to size, except for the long sleeves. My husband wears a 44 in the chest so I started to get an XL so he could have some room, but after reading another review about the sleeves being really long I decided to go with the M/L. The vest could have been a little bigger, as it fit "just right", but the sleeves were long and if I had gotten the XL, they would have been way too long! Overall, I would recommend it to others because it worked and looked great.
END
Another great pair of Vans!
END
Girlfriend Loves it
END
cute but not what i thought it would be. it looks fuller in the picture or more ruffled but it's not like that. but it is soft and what not so i can't complain too too much.
END
As the title says, the hat is both attractive and feels nice. Its very soft and silky feeling. Its pretty wide fit.
END
Love this top!! Fits how I expected and it's a great look for summer. I'll wear it with slim white pants. Can be worn on or off the shoulder. Priced well and shipped fast. Recommend this seller.
END
Broke after 2 uses :(
END
Fit as expected. The lights are a nice addition. They are removable, that being said- they come out easy... sometimes a little too easy. Overall a good buy for your ugly sweater wearing pleasure.
END
I ordered size based on sizing chart provided
END
In the picture the necklace has a cream rose on it, but when received the rose was a dark mustard yellow. I compared it to the pick on line and nothing so my husband suggested they might have had a light shining on it that detorted the color so I tried that and once again no. I was very disappointed in the necklace I received and so glad it was on clearance.
END
This is what my wife has to say about this item:  A little heavier than I thought it would be, but other than that, excellent quality necklace. The hinges are a little stuff but that's an easy fix. I'm a huge disney and Little Mermaid fan and this was the perfect birthday gift! Thanks Disney for gorgeous sophisticated jewelry for the adult disney fans.
END
Beautiful, love it.
END
My grandson really likes them.
END
Son loves this mask
END
The product itself was very cute! It was just like the picture so I give it a full five stars!  However it does infact run smaller. Mostly in the bust area. Knowing this I thought I ordered a medium however I did not. So it doesn't really fit me.  Now I am about 5" and weigh around 105 pounds. I wear a 32 C and I think the medium would have fit me fine. Now if you are my height but where an A or small B then a small should fit you well. The length of the shirt was great and the arms were also perfect.  Just beware busty ladies!!!
END
Good enough for me.
END
awesome
END
Really like the material and how it fit perfectly.
END
Very Cute, I ordered a medium and it fits great, it does stretch.
END
It broke the second time I put it on.
END
Excellent material at a very reasonable price.
END
Excellent
END
I love this sports bra the only thing I would change is that I wish the straps were thinner. That's all. Great support and really cute back straps. Fits true to size
END
This box is extremely well made, heavy, beautiful design and seems to be cold resin. I would give it as a gift! I use mine for my jewelry. I adore this box!
END
Beautiful masks, nice quality.   I would love to have the option to choose the colors but in general they look great
END
Right fit.
END
It's tough to know how to rate this.  It's a well made wallet but is also cheap-looking.  It's not a luxury wallet but also for $20 one shouldn't expect that.  I decided to stop using it after two weeks and switch to a more luxury product that I paid ~$50 for but that's my personal taste.  You get what you pay for but as far as $20 wallets, this is a pretty good one.
END
Great product, great deal!!!!
END
This hat was ok. This is one of two hats that I purchased.
END
Ordered this costume and I received it quickly. Unfortunately as I opened it the pieces stuck together and had lots of discoloration. If it had been just a place or two I wouldn't of cared but over half the skirt was discolored. Kind of disappointed.
END
These are cool to look at but freaking stupid to put on. They screw on from the back, so not only can you not see what you are doing but you can't even get them on. And they broke the first time I tried. I'm just glad they didn't cost a whole lot.
END
Don't buy this if you have boobs. The cup size is way small with no room to give. It's not possible to adjust this either the padding is sewn in so you would destroy the dress if you tried to.
END
very pretty - will work just fine
END
Sleves were too short, otherwise fits well
END
good design, and fits my face
END
Have gotten so many compliments on these! Comfortable yet unique
END
I love it 
END
Very soft and did not hurt my sons face.  This one is so much nicer than most you see in stores.
END
This bag is cute and huge and I love it! Big enough for all of my things. ALL of the sippers work and it seems well made. I was worried because of some other review but this is a cute, functional purse!
END
I was so pleased with this clutch really nice had nice weight to it, soooo pretty.
END
It's really nice but the material is quite thin. You'll need to wear a peticoat underneath to conceal the underwear.
END
very nice
END
It fits extremely small as a xxl it should of been labeled a LG instead
END
Nice, but larger than expected and heavy.  Bought these for my 80 year old mom. She doesn't wear them much
END
Fits like a glove and very comfy and cute!!
END
This necklace came In and it looked just like the picture except that several of the words were either missing or misspelled. You get what you pay for. The clover part was pretty tho. Update - we have had this necklace for years and while we had to pay a jeweler ten bucks to replace the diamonds it has not rusted or tarnished. Still looks brand new. We only kept the clover part.
END
I love this hat. The coverage is amazing and there is an adjustable string for it to better fit your child's head. I use it on my 2.5 yr old daughter. The coverage is the same if not more than the Flap Happy hat.
END
This shirt is super cute, its one of my new favs!!  As suggested, I ordered a size up (I'm normally a M, I ordered a L) and it fits great with no problems.  Its not too long and its not too wide in the shoulders or anything.  The quality is actually not bad, it's cotton but its thick and doesn't feel super cheap or anything.  Would definitely purchase again from this same company.
END
Cute shirt. I wear it every now and then. Made wrong nit lose at all. I am fairly small frame, bought size bigger then what the charts said, still fit little snug on my arms and chest. I am 5'5" 128lbs 32 aaa bra size.  Wash. Let it air dry, pull a little and fits better.
END
Loved it.....would buy from again.
END
The sunglasses did not even fit my face they were way to small i did like the soft rims tho but i was disapoinited in the product sorry.
END
I ordered these ear skins for my friend because she wanted matching ones like mine but I couldn't find any under 0g in stores and other places sell these ear skins for at least double the price! These were very cheap, but they still looked awesome and my friend loved them! I highly recommend them!
END
I was very excited to get this dress but it's extremely small. It looked more like a shirt than a dress. I'm normally a size small (5'6" and 110 lbs) so I thought it would fit me, but it looked like the dress was made to fit a 10 year old. I ended up giving the dress away. The dress is cute, but also thin and not great quality. You can only wear it if you have the body of a small child.
END
Took a month to get here with no tracking. Smaller then I thought and I'm almost positive this isn't actually quartz.
END
Clips are strong. Well made
END
My daughters feet are little small so she was not able to wear them at 12 months but very cute and comfortable
END
Beautiful, well made sunglasses.
END
Exactly what I wanted. The first one I ordered didn't work for me. This one does. I can't say enough about how good the customer service is.
END
A okay
END
This runs small
END
Nice looking purse!  Is small but fits what I need Is very light weight whic. I love
END
I liked the braclet part of this but the cross could have better quality it looks cheap to a point
END
It's a really great kimono for the price. Thankfully it survived my vacation w/o tearing. Love it!
END
Good quality but XS is way too big for me -- wasted my money :-(
END
great
END
Ok band, clearly not the quality of a genuine band by Apple, but for 1/4 of the price it works.
END
Nice band. They were a bit dry so I prepped them with a commercial leather treatment lotion. They are ready for the deployment clasp and soon, that retro-looking Nixon Ranger, that I've been eyeballing for some time now.
END
Well. It fits and its comfortable. With that being said, the first time I wore it, although I adjusted the straps to fit properly without being overly tight, they ended overstretching and now they look like strips of cooked bacon. The band did the same thing, and sadly, I had ordered a size larger than I normally would so that it would accommodate flucations in breast size while I breastfeed, so the band is actually slightly loose on me even on the tightest setting - which should definitely not be causing the bacon effect. For the record, I also hand washed and air dried this, so that is not the issue either. I really wish it had better elasticity, because it has the potential to be a very comfortable, flattering bra.
END
Needed a garden dress for niece's wedding shower. Was a little leery of purchasing without trying on but am just so impressed with the quality, shape and fit of this dress! I may purchase more for the summer. The dress fabric is stretchy so its a little forgiving if you don't know exactly the size to get. Received many compliments on the dress at the wedding shower.
END
I did not know that it was so thin and see through
END
I love it, just the right size
END
I work at a school where our mascot is an owl, so this was a cute gift to colleagues.  What a bargain!  I ordered ten and the watches all seem to be in working order, although for the price I don't even care - they are cute just as pendants.
END
Super warm and quite soft-very happy with these!
END
Could only wear one time. Bled in the wash only the white.
END
Thin materials, sizes are not true to fit, they run small..
END
The only thing i dislike about this clutch is that there is not an inner pocket for change. It is large enough though to keep a small coin purse in the clutch. The pockets are deep and getting coins out of it is a little awkward. It holds my phone and a few essentials like nail clippers and lip balms. I love the color i chose and am very pleased with this clutch. Delivery was incredibly fast.
END
Small  there is no elastic band
END
Fit perfectly, only flaw is the inside fabric is peeling away already we've had them for a couple of weeks and haven't worn every day.
END
Pretty & nice.
END
Love my tee shirt it's dope literally i don't mean it in a bad way people, the tee shirt has much swagger to it and people love it...
END
I needed one size larger, but overall satisfied
END
Just like photo :)
END
Overall pretty set. Got this because my fingers swell up in the summer months and this looks similar to my regular rings. I like the engagement ring - sits a little higher then I'm used to but it's ok. The stone looks nice, not too fake; it's set so you can see the bottom point of the stone which I also like. The wedding band matches perfectly in design, but looks cheaper. The stones in the band are set at uneven depths and don't have a lot of shine or sparkle to them. Overall this is a decent set. I'm just hoping the stones don't fall out.
END
If you haven't tried them you don't know what your missing.  I own 8 pairs and it's all I will wear.  Very comfortable.
END
This dress looks cute till I put it on. The slit with fabric is off, it goes right up my crotch. Id have to sew a lace insert in the middle.  It doesnt go up the leg like it should, if I try to pull the dress over the breast cup part moves over too much exposing one entire breast.
END
Feels nice and hangs in a nice flowy way.
END
Just what I was looking for.
END
I love these hoop earrings! They can be left in all the time and do not irritate my ears (my 2nd & 3rd ear piercings are sensitive to the type of metal). I love that they are thicker in width too! Would buy again and recommend.
END
Most of the balls were striped out. They kept falling out. Not very happy with them at all..   Thank you   Amanda Harris
END
like it

First of all I would like to start by saying that I am very satisfied with the purchase I made of this slim fit long sleeve shirt I bought for my husband. I was very excited when I received my packet to see that it was very well delivered. I was nicely folded inside a plastic bag with no wrinkles. Once he opened it, we noticed that this is a true blue. No faded colors at all. The design was pretty nice and well made. He said the material felt fresh and it fit him perfectly like we expected this slim fit shirt to fit. My husband is pretty slim but has a weird shape body, I would say he has some love handles on the side. When he put his shirt on it helped cover that little trouble area. I did receive this product at a low or reduced price in exchange for my honest review and here you have it folks. I would say I will definitely be ordering more of this shirts as he loves how they fit and feel. I did say overall this is a good quality product.
END
Same as before. Poor quality. Not something I could give to my wife.
END
For the price i expected something better I won't buy anything. The material its low quality and not worth the price
END
I work retail, on my feet all day. These insoles help a lot. I will buy more.
END
Thanks for the fun color Pajama jeans, I have not one complaint about these pants.  I read some reviews that indicated my post baby body might not be a good fit for this style as the pants must slip on without a zipper or button to help get the top over the widest part of my hips.  It hasn't been a problem for me, I think the bigger the difference between you waist and hip the more that problem might bother you.  My hips are abt 43 and where the waist band fits around my waist is abt 39. I bought the large 12-14 size.
END
Way too big around the upper rib cage area. Not beneficial at all.
END
Very nice bracelet - the beads are substantial, not too light or plastic. The are also smooth and comfortable. I am someone who gets really annoyed with bracelets while typing on the computer - but this doesn't droop off the wrist and so it doesn't "clank" on the keyboard. Totally works while working! The garnet is very dark, almost black unless you are looking at it in the light. Classy and expensive looking/feeling. I like the little bead made up of rhinestones (or is it zircons??) just very understated, lovely and glams up the whole look slightly. This one will be on regular rotation on my wrist - I now think it's one of the nicest bracelets I own. Recommend!  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I only buy and review products I am genuinely interested in using. These are my opinions and personal experience which are not influenced by the seller.
END
Sold and delivered as promised. This ring is worth a lot more than what they are selling it for. Very happy
END
the leather on this feels great and overall i am happy with it, especially given the price. the only reason this isn't 5 stars is the strap sticks out a bit too far once the watch is on. it would have been better if they spaced the second metal ring a bit farther away from the clasp or added a third one to keep the strap contained. i use a small rubber band to serve as a third ring.
END
I'm 6ft, 220lbs, would've liked a higher size since I love baggy/loose fit but it fits pretty well. Nice and comfy, keeps you warm
END
Has more shine then I thought it would given other reviews. I have short average sized fingers with large knuckles from years of martial arts. Some rings make my fingers look fat but 3MM is just right. It is almost slimming. Glad I went in blind I love it.
END
These are super cute but run way big! I ordered in my standard size and have to return for a whole size smaller--I have pretty big feet!
END
Love them, fit great, look awesome, I'm satisfied thus this product in nice
END
It took me 3 weeks to finally decide on this purse.  I absolutely love my new purse!  It's built well and does everything I was looking for.  I didn't want a purse that collapsed when I set it down but one where the items stay put.  I also require the 'kiss' closure.  I love the old fashioned look, I had a purse similar to this as a child, another reason I love it.  Everywhere I go I get compliments on my purse!  I highly recommend this lovely accessory!!  Now I'm eyeing the pink one for spring.....
END
Great item.  They are really soft and warm.
END
Love it
END
Love it. Exactly what I expected from the photos and reviews- it's a study yet high quality passport holder.  I do kind of wish there was a built in strap to hold the passport book down.. but we can't have everything we want.
END
This product is amazing. everything about it screams luxury. I love it.
END
The top is attractive but I must say shorter in length than what I would have expected. (I find that a little disappointing.)  I should have ordered a small as well but I can alter it and make it fit more like it should. As mentioned in other reviews the fabric is sheer. Not something to wear without a bra unless you don't mind that sort of thing. ;) Very comfortable top. I can see it will be a favorite of mine during the summer.
END
I ordered this jacket for my boyfriend for his birthday, and ordered a few sizes up after reading the reviews. It was still extremely small on him. He loves the style, but he can't wear it because the sleeves are so small that they hurt his arms. The material isn't very soft (and balls up- you know what I'm talking about) and is obviously very cheaply made when you touch it. The shipping took forever as well. And when I say forever, I mean months.
END
Too Snug
END
This Is What They Said To Me :  Very Poor Service They Are Unprofessional And Very Disrespectful .
END
It's just as in , picture . It did a have a little smell to it but it's nothing that can't go away . I like it
END
Love this bracelet!! Very cute, looks just like in the picture.. Didn't take long to ship either!! '
END
Construction - made well, but it's made more a man than for a woman.

V neck in photo but comes in and it's a round neck dress.

I want to tell you my sizes before I go in to detail for you to understand how it fits: Pants: Juniors 13 Bra: 36DDD  I found that this suit fits very well! It seems to be made with a high quality fabric that will hold up over time, it is not thin by any means or flimsy. I really like the workmanship of this suit. I ordered a 3XL as like i stated I normally wear a 13 in jeans and it fit very well, the only complaint I have is that it has awkward cups on it lol. But overall I find it to be very comfortable and stylish!  Disclosure: I received this product at a discount or for free in exchange for my HONEST UNBIASED review of the product. All opinions are my own and I hope that my review helps you with your purchasing decision making!
END
I ordered this purse as soon as I saw the pictures and read the reviews after. Like all the others I really like the antiqued metal on the bag and it did look to be a darker brown. I really got the bag to travel with for its size which is perfect! Literally the shape and the amount of pockets makes up for the very minor differences from the picture. I've gotten tons of compliments on it and over all very pleased!
END
I wish I could give a 5star but they are just a bit big oh and I really appreciate the petit lenght thank you
END
Beautiful and just in time for Easter! Only kicker is the neck hole is nowhere near large enough to be off-shoulder.
END
Very nice glasses. Sturdy, well made.
END
This product is made from cheap material and was not constructed well.
END
A bit smelly at first. one or two days under the sun and it's done.
END
Wow wow wow! I love these boots! I listened to other reviews and got a size smaller and they fit perfectly, with some room. I am normally a 6 but I purchased a 5.5. So far my boots don't seem to be slippery on the bottom as other customers have stated. They are comfy to walk and are so pretty! I brought black suede with brown heel and I highly recommend them!
END
arrived on time - as described - or better.  so much finer than competing product i ordered another to replace the competition...and will do the same for another older belt.
END
Great quality, but too small.  Love the owl.

Dad loved it

Broke first time i wore like its from a 25 cent machine

this does not really look like the pic, it balloons out and looks more like a maternity dress, i had to return it for my wife

color changed within one month
END
Really cute and soft!

Nice shirt to bad i can't wear it all year round
END
Great shoes! Got them for our trip to Cabo where the beach is rocky. She would also wear them in the pool and they offered great traction in the kiddie pool. It's been 6 months we have been using them all summer long. We just rinse them off with tap water and outside (out of the sun) to dry. So far so good. Definitely got my money's worth for them.
END
Socks are a little tight
END
Perfect!
END
Love it!!!!
END
Great backpack. My daughter carried it to school all year and I was very happy that it held up the entire time. Very well made and sturdy. Would certainly purchase one again!
END
Great to contain small accidents.
END
Absolutely stunning and gorgeous!!!!  It's slightly heavy but LOOKS like the retail price of $398 (Amazon says $298) on the tag it came with!  It came carefully packaged in a nice fancy magnetic box. However, it did not fit my iPhone 6 so my husband placed my phone in his pocket, problem solved!!  Got compliments galore!  I used it for a formal ball and since I attend one to two formal events every year, it will get some use.
END
I gave these as a birthday gift to my Batman loving Bestie. She loved them, but they broke the 1st time she wore them.
END
Great quality product. We did have to have additional tulle added to make fuller though.
END
The Weekender is nice and roomy, but the handles could stand to be a little longer to make it easier to carry over the shoulder when the bag is full.  The zippered interior pocket is big enough to hold an iPhone, keys, chapstick and a few other things too.  The full zippered closure on top makes this ideal for carrying in wet or snowy weather...because everything stays dry on the inside.
END
good
END
Not authentic. Very low quality.
END
For granddaughter she carries it every where she goes
END
I like these ear muffs very much. I had Ear Pops in the past, but they did not have any insulation so the wind could blow through the thin material when biking at 20 MPH and chill my ears. These new ones have a protective layer at the center and keep my ears warm even when biking at 25 degrees Fahrenheit.
END
Stitching was baf
END
This dress was so small I had to turn it into a t shirt, the t shirt was a crop top! Although I loved my shirt, I ordered a dress and I wouldve loved my dress even more. Bummed!
END
I think they're very cute, but they fit me way to small, I'm not considered fat but I guess I have thighs & they really get in the way, I suggest they add in the discription that these are ment to fit petite bodies.
END
Excellent quality and price^^
END
Cheap fabric but inexpensive so got what I paid for.
END
The color is only a tiny bit more beige than it is pink in person. I got a size small and it fit me perfectly, without squeezing my waist after I eat a meal. It hits me just above my kneecap. I am 5"4' and my waist is 26.5 inches. :)
END
One was broken.
END
I had problems with frayed laces so I gave these a try. They definitely will solve that problem. My only issue is slightly cosmetic as the laces appear to have tips that match the laces color, but what I received had metal silver tips.
END
It did have a smell but you can't beat it for the price.
END
These look cool, sure, but the lenses are too dark, and the frames are pretty uncomfortable (and I've worn many types of wayfarer-style knockoffs with no issue). I guess that's what one gets for the price.
END
I really loved this dress! I'm a pretty large girl, usually fit a size L/XL. I got the M/L and it was pretty loose, but I knew that if I got the S/M, it wouldn't fit well, so I didn't exchange it. I'm also 5'3 and the dress was too long for my liking. It came down a tiny bit past my knees. I wouldn't have worn it if I couldn't shorten it, but my mom shortened it up for me. Super cute now!
END
This dress was beautiful, I had to have it altered but thats was ok, it wasn't super expensive. My only complaint was that the sleeves were too tight and it felt like my boobs were touching my chin so the seamstress added a little lace in the shoulders to bring it down... after that it fit perfect
END
Fit my son perfect! After a while it did begin to stretch. Now my oldest daughter can fit it. So I gave a 4 star for that reason.
END
Do not like it because of the size that is so wrong.  And I did order XL.  Still did not fit on a L size.
END
More off-white then white. Fits nice,though.
END
BEAUTIFUL... LOVE MY BRACELET. ON MY WRIST RIGHT NOW.
END
I'm petite and weight 128 lbs and wear medium in everything. I read all the reviews that it runs small and so i decided to purchase a large. now it's too big for me. I even could fit a small.
END
very low quality. fake looking. returned
END
It just looks so different in person than in the photograph I personally didn't like it but they shipped it quick it just doesn't look great in person
END
Nice shirt. Decent shipping.

good very flexible.

My girl loved it
END
Adorable and very well made!  My daughter loves it.  :)

no really great warm socks toes never so warm

Excellent watch

Very see-through bottom and runs extremely small. I got an xl and normally wear a size 6 us and it was still suffocatingly small
END
Great fit, great shirt.
END
Nice prices for sturdy reading glasses.
END
Super soft and comfy, but the fabric pilled badly after only one wear. I'll keep them to wear around the house. Too bad. I really liked them.
END
I got this as a gift for a friend that's a fan of pikachu and she loved it. The item is exactly as advertised and it looks awesome. Very nice material and details. It was shipped really fast and it arrived in time.
END
This fanny pack is bad ass!!! Went to zoo for its 4th annual craft beer tasting event and we were jamming out to my gangasta ass tunes from rock to rap to punk to an old ass lady dancing to drake!! Fanny pack was a big hit battery life was awesome lasted all night and didn't drain my iPhone. Best buy
END
It's a good product.
END
like the fit and the cut for my pregnancy
END
Runs small, but I knew that, so I ordered a size up. Lightweight enough to wear to WDW without spending $80 at the park. Cool vintage look too.

Cheap fabric colors of stripes don't  match non stretch tread

4 STARS  -  Haven't Seen The Actual Overall Quality Of The Hat So Can't Give Any Informed Opinion Because It Was A Gift.  The Only Reason I Gave It 4 Stars Is My Nephew Loved It, Wears It Everyday, and The $10.00 Price Was The Max Amount I Was Willing Pay For Anything That May Benefit Monetarily A Loose Mouth, Obnoxious, Ego Maniac Like Donald Trump. But I Do Believe We Need To "Make America Great Again" And I Do Believe That Most Politians Are WORTHLESS, Disingenuous, Lying, Pieces Of Garbage. OUR COUNTRY IS A SINKING SHIP AND WE HAVE NO OTHER CHOICES BUT TO UNLEASH TRUMP LOL!  I Figure With His Big Mouth He Ignites World War 3, Or Finally Fixes The Mess We Are In, Or Ends Up Assassinated. ALL BETS ARE OFF SO WHAT DO WE HAVE TO LOSE.  Merry Christmas Everybody!
END
Love the charm but after wearing for some time it turned brown. Useless now.
END
Excellent quality, beautiful colors & designs, perfect fit, and fast shipping. Thanks! These are some of the best nursing scrub tops I've found.
END
My son absolutely loved these. Wore them every day. After a few weeks a couple LED's stopped working and there were issues charging them. I contacted the seller requesting a replacement pair and the said they no longer carried that model. They did offer a refund or pick a different style shoe, but my son wanted these and wouldn't let me send them back. So now he has a gold pair of sneakers which won't light up anymore.
END
I bought this ring for everyday wear because my wedding band had small diamonds on top which causes it to brush against the clothing. I constantly had to pull out tiny strings of fabric that got stuck to the wedding band. I find this ring much more comfortable. Im a true size 5 and so I order this in size 5 and it fits perfectly. The metal is shiny and light, I barely notice it on my finger (which is a plus for me). It also doesn't get in the way of my cleaning, cooking, showering, clothing, etc.. looks like my wedding band will have to stay in a box for a while.
END
So cute!
END
Bought for my daughter for Christmas!!  She absolutely loves it!!!!
END
super cute and soft. very comfortable and great for a simple chic look
END
Good quality, looks good, I've been wearing it a lot this winter.
END
The arms and under the arms seems to run small. The other portions were great.  I hope it's not gonna shrink when its washed. The color on-line was not the color of the shirt. Listed as a pink watermelon, it's very much a orangy melon color.
END
THey are very sturdy and easy to walk in but after a couple months of having them the back near the ankle ripped where the stitching is at tho
END
Bad color match to computer view
END
Top has cone shaped breasts. The padding is hard and cant be removed. Gave me and armored look. Will fit better in a large bust. Bottom has great coverage of mom pouch and stayed and while swimming. Ordered a 2nd suit for a friend smaller size and the top was the same.
END
I love it
END
Just because they are white, they do need a washing regularly but I have received many compliments on how pretty these white and pink shoes are. Extremely good Nike quality. Highly recommended.
END
The fabric is super comfortable and the design is amazingly cute. I love that it's light in color but not sheer or flimsy.  Note on fit: I sized up because I wanted a loose fit like in the product photo, and it was perfect. Depending on how you want it to fit, that might be good to keep in mind.
END
Very cheap material. Like paper. Too cheap to wear and wash.
END
I ordered this to wear on a cruise and I was so glad I did! There were shorts under the skirt which made me feel more comfortable and covered compared to the usual underwear type bottoms.
END
It was exactly what I was looking for
END
Was trying to get it on and it broke.  Not well made at all
END
This is what my husband was looking for his reading glasses.  They fit nicely in his pocket or in the compartment in the car.
END
Design was shifted to the side a little. Would love to get a reprinted one but might be to late to return by now. Thank you for the purchase all the same.
END
My favorite tie! The colors are beautiful, and match with a navy or brown-type suit. Used on my wedding day, and for the groomsmen. Our suits were navy, and they looked great. Excellent length, size, quality, and pattern. And you can't beat the price! Will be buying other colors as well.
END
Sexy. I love these tights. Boyfriend goes crazy over them.
END
excellent
END
Great swim shorts. My 6 month old is on the chunky side (18lbs) and I bought the 12 month size which fit perfectly
END
Very nice, very comfortable, very well-made, good-looking T-shirt.  The best T-shirt I own.  Who knew?!
END
Could not get on the size chart to compare sizes.  You need to make it easier to access a size chart.
END
1st, I wanna thank u all for ur clear understanding to the emergence of my situation & belining the dress w/express sh. The other Co.'s didn't bother (still not here, tho I paid express) & "nearly" ruined everything for my other girls. Anywho, this daughter... Absolutely loves it, & danced around in it an hr when it arrived. My mom n I liked the fit, the fabric color  vibrancy & quality. It went well with all her rhinestone accessories - Again thank you
END
it is not lower in the middle. the under non see through part is see through and is awkwardly a half footish maybe longer, than the see through top part. it is not v necked and is wayyyyy to tight and high up around that area. i added a think belt and it looked a little better but this is not at all what i was expecting and what was seen in the picture
END
Ive used this over and over again! I can probably even use it AFTER my pregnancy.
END
These are nylons, not warm socks.
END
I will use it to help me to lose more weight
END
Very strong chemical smell, which hopefully will wash out.  However, the L/XL was way too small with side and center cleavage.  I'm 5'2",  102#,  33 1/2" bust.
END
Love them! Compliments every time I wear them...
END
Got this for my 14 year old daughter and it fit her perfectly. She's a tall 5'7" teen but I loved how even though its a two piece, it still was a modest two piece.
END
excellent

Just as pictured... very nice belt ... arrived on time and in excellent condition

This is beautiful.  It is so sparkly I love it
END
It's alright for the price, it's puffy, but in a kind of awkward way. The green was not true to color at allllll. I expected mint green and it looks like faded blue that was disappointing. :/
END
It's a nice bracelet. I'm enjoying it very much.
END
Fit as expected, love the style, for the price not too bad, i order twice my normal size as i like it loose!
END
Terrible quality! Tried to return to seller and she told me to "give to a friend or donate!" I said "if you ordered a meal at a restaurant and didn't like it and the server told you to give it to someone else without a refund would you be happy?" I wear a size 4 and ordered a Large and I could barely fit my arm into it! H&M brand, cheap material.
END
It sits closer to my waist than my hips and the sleeves are closer to being full length than 3/4 sleeve. Weird. Usually when you're tall the sleeves and shirt length are both too short but this shirt is the exception.
END
DONT BUY IT
END
Cheap looming5
END
This jacket looks cute in the photo but is not well made. Asian sizes.
END
Fabric was not smooth like i expected but i absolutely love the pattern and it look great on me!
END
Look better in person i love them. Would definetly repurchase in other colors.
END
Great color and fabric was good quality. Used these to make a pirate bag for my daughter's summer camp
END
Excellent, I bought this because I already owned one in black and loved it so I got this one in silver to segment my cards into debit/credit.  To be fair they both live in my safe, so I'm not really rough on them nor have I tested the RFID security, but they do a great job of keeping my cards organized and protected inside my safe.
END
Bought these as a gift for a 90 year old and she loves them. She especially liked that they came up a little higher on her leg. They feel great and have held up well after multiple washings.
END
love it
END
I really like the design of this year and will get a lot of years use out of it. It is not as thick as I would like hence the like it star and not the love it.
END
DID NOT LIKE THESE AT ALL,. LOTS OF STRINGS FROM THE FINGERS WHERE THEY CUT THEM OFF, THEY NEEDED TO FINISH THE TIPS OF THEM AND THEY WERE SHORT ON MY HAND
END
cool sungasses!
END
Every day. Started to get a bit smelly after 4 months.
END
Was cute but too short. I returned it. Maybe try ordering a size up and see if that works.
END
I like it a lot. Although a little thin but the dress is cute and has flowy material and stretchy.
END
Great leather strap and the jump-hour complication is something different, but if you have difficulty reading a date display on your current watch without glasses, you will not be able to tell what hour it is without your glasses since the hour of the day is displayed like a date complication on other watches.
END
I like it not bad
END
I have fondness for watches that either have complications or unusual appearance. This watch is unusual in appearance and has a complication. All three of the movements have the hacking complication. The overall construction quality is very good considering the price. The strap is genuine leather. If you are a watch geek you will not be disappointed!
END
Fit is great! Colors are nice and bright!!
END
These are fantastic shirts for anyone with a bit of belly LOL as the side ruching makes for front ridges that hide quite a bit, while also making it nicely fitted and giving you some shape. Also nice to add some fun splashes of color to the usual subdued long sleeve wardrobe. The colors and sleeve length make this nice transitional piece. It's held up well in the wash, too. No shrinking or stretching, no pilling, no color fade. So far I see nothing to dislike.
END
This would've gotten five stars if the skirt was longer. The back of the skirt sits just above my butt, this is a must-wear-legging costume. I'm 5'7, 36C, I wear a medium in everything. This fit perfectly, slightly snug but isn't a problem. The hat isn't as appealing as the pic but nothing a touchup can't fix. -If you have a small bust there might be a baggy gap in the chest area. -If you have a chubby torso then I suggest you skip this outfit or else you won't be able to zip the back. -The chain links are fragile, sow some extra thread to make it secure. Other than that this costume is pretty warm, made with good fabric and stylish.
END
Love this top! It's true to size, with the sleeves a teensy bit long--they go down my hands a little, but it looks great. I bought the white one, and it is a bit see-through, but it's a nice, lightweight t-shirt material, allowing me to wear long sleeves on warm days.
END
What a great deal!! Exactly as described, I loved these headbands so much.. They were perfecf
END
Met my expectation. This product and seller is recommended.
END
Very form fitting.  Nice quality thicker fabric.  Arms are long.  I had to fold them up, but my arms are shorter anyway.  I wore it for a Gilligan outfit.
END
I got one of these in 2013 when I was in Disneyland and loved it!  Washes well and holds up extremely well.  Has not lost it's shape - a little faded from washing and drying (wash in warm, dry in warm) - but a great nite shirt!  Even some of the glitter is still on the shirt and I wear it every nite.
END
I really liked this shirt, but it ripped near the button the first time I wore it
END
Everything was in great condition and the item was just as described!
END
is horribe quality top part is too long my babay do not like too weer this she said "my tummy hurts"
END
Runs a little small but nice.  Shoulder pads are not really there but it works okay.  It is nice under some sheer tops.
END
It is too flimsy, but it is pretty. Fits a little tight at the hip, but for people who are thin I don't think that should be a problem.
END
It is perfect
END
as advertised
END
It's just okay
END
IT WORKS GREAT
END
Beautiful colors and wonderful quality!
END
The color was magenta but I ordered the pants based on the photo on the model and that color was not the same as the pants I received. It color in the photo is inaccurate. The mane of the color "magenta" is accurate.
END
Love this necklace!
END
Bands are very thin and cheaply made. Not at all what I expected them to be. They barely even stretch.
END
It's pretty bad !! Plus it smells like chemicals I got a rash just trying it on! Never ordering shirts again this was badly made smelled bad and it fit so weird.
END
Thanks

DC Comics Deluxe Wonder Women Adult Costume is "OK" dress & Cape are nice quality but boot covers ripped while trying on and star logo on headband was already rubbed off upon opening the package. I would not be deterred from ordering this costume because you can replace the accessories with better ones online. My suggestion: Order the Wonder Women wig and platform boots to really make this costume awesome. This costume does run BIG I am between a size 7-8 and a small fit good could probably have ordered an xs. Over all I can't wait to wear the costume on Halloween. IMO the wig is awesome! Very soft and bouncy! If you don't have "wonder women" hair naturally get the wig from 7th Ave Store online. The wig comes packaged in a box not a bag! They had fast shipping too.
END
It's a good to wear tops, but the neckline is too deep ..
END
Another gift for granddaughter which she reallllllly loved!
END
Its not too tight. It gives some height to my scarves so it really looks like I have hair underneath the scarf still. All around it is a great fit and I love this product and the other products from this company. Going to be purchasing more!
END
These leggings worked out well. They are comfortable and cute.  The size was as expected.  I like the extra care put in the waist because it makes the pants fit a bit better.
END
Instead of being floor length, the skirt barely reached my knees
END
GO CANES! Fits awesome and shipping was fast!!
END
Came sooner than expected and fiy just right.
END
This necklace is sooo cute and it goes great with my red hair but it is so poorly made. About 5 stones were missing and the lobster clasp broke while I was wearing it, it lasted for about 5 minutes.
END
I use these for my Cardio Dance class and they are perfect and very cute. I would definitely recommend. They also cam earlier than expected!!
END
Our son is 8. These glasses are very small, they don't fit at all, halfway through trying them on, we realized they would probably brake if we would push them on further back on his head. We now put them on our cat Bella, she is a thrill.
END
I absolutely hated this I personally think it's a cheap knock off it has uncomfortable boning that bends in and pokes you .. It's miserable to wear u can barely breathe and gives no support and it's very short comes just below my belly button I don't think the problem was with the size it's just a cheap made product that completely explains the price if u want a good waist trainer invest in a quality one
END
So cute and look great
END
FINALLY! GREAT JACKET FOR THE PRICE! I love that you can wear in 60 degree weather and don't end up boiling inside. I had asked the seller for jacket info and so for those who want the EMBLEM STITCHED ON, order the BROWN COLOR option. The emblem on the back will remain a PRINT though, just FYI. On my first day wearing this and two people immediately gave good comments about it! Awesome for just an everyday jacket!
END
The wife is happy with it, so I'm happy.
END
Very nice look and material.  Fits good, with just enough room for a sweatshirt if you want one.
END
I am 5'2" and weigh about 100 pounds, but I was so afraid that this would be too small, I ordered the XL..I would have ordered Jumbo if they had it...and it is too large, but it is beautiful.  I am going to try the medium
END
I have the tan one (store bought) and I wanted another but it may seem the same even if they are the same brand name, its clearly not its made of different material VERY ITCHY cant even wear it .....
END
Awesome! The packaging was almost impossible to get into though XD I also adore the extra gift!
END
Excellent
END
very comfy,fits my arch perfect. top of foot pain caused by dorsal compression syndrome feeling much better after few days. will buy more for other shoes. how they hold up only time will tell.
END
amazing every one needs these
END
Bought a size up from what everyone said I would need....seriously wasn't even close to fitting me.
END
Tooooooooo small! Xl runs very small. Nice shirt, but have to return it.
END
I Love this swimsuit IF it came in a 2XL. my butt hangs outs (though I think it's a scrunch butt) and the band size a kinda short.
END
Perfect in every way
END
I purchased two of these, pink and purple.  This is the kind of scarf that, because of the design, has to grow on you.  It's rather different from the way it's pictured because there are parts that are very transparent (see-through) and that makes it very unusual.  At first, I didn't like it, but as I looked at it, and put them up against a matching turtleneck, I started to like themt more and more.  So they've grown on me and they look beautiful with a coordinating top and a skirt.  I'm very happy that I got them and have received many compliments on them.  Beautiful enough for a gift!
END
I just received this hat the other day, and couldn't wait to wear it. Well as soon as I entered the subway car, at least six women were memorized by the beautiful sparkling flower. The hat is made very well, and fits really nicely. The hat is also is adjustable. Great for these snowy rainy days. It also comes in an array of other fabulous colors.
END
The best
END
Very pretty!!! I love them!! Thsnk you!!!
END
Very Very thick!
END
Is not as good as is shown in the picture...I wear lager but the top is so small I wish I can send it back...lemme know if it is possible to send it back..thanks
END
Was a little surprised on the material, but it was okay.  The price was good, so I decided it was good for the dollars.
END
This was a cute idea but the product is a total waste of money. The fabric on the shorts and the plastic material are very cheap. I put the shorts on and it immediately ripped right below the butt. So I got out the sewing machine, sewed it back together and within 20 minutes it ripped again. It would be better to charge more and have a product that would last through the party.
END
This poorly constructed dress was off-color and had strings hanging from it. It was not as depicted and fit poorly.
END
Made mother very happy.
END
These are wonderful for a postpartum mother. They help with covering my tummy and go up high enough so that I can breast feed and not show too much of my stomach. I am 5'1" so they are a little long but that is expected. You can see through them a little as well so be sure to wear longer tops.
END
They were really nice sandals but they ran too small. I had to return them. The company is a very pleasant company to work with. I recommend purchasing from them in the future.
END
I love the look and feel of this bag. It's a real basic, simple messenger bag. The only thing I wish it had more functional and smaller pockets under the flap for storage of small things.
END
This is the most entertaining and hilarious gift ever. My daughter loves it!!!
END
I got my Vera Wang v200 sunglasses and immediately fell in love with the vintage design but when I touched them it seemed cheap. Their box looks as if it doesn't fit the sunglasses size. Checking the internet I saw some sites mentioning this item is made in Italy. Mine was made in China - I wonder if it's really authentic?!
END
Fast and perfect
END
Was gift for great granddaughter. Her mother said it was fine.
END
way to small pretty but tiny im a thick girl
END
It's pretty yes. It is 3x lighter than the pictures and the top of to small for going with a 2x bottom. With all of that being said. I'm more confident in this than any other bathing suit.
END
One ring was fine the other had bubbling of the inner finish. Poor quality. I expected more of a licensed BBC product
END
Good
END
Its much more beautiful than I  expected. The colors are vibrant. You'll love it!
END
Same presence as shown by picture.
END
I had high hopes.  My five year old really wanted Star Wars shoes that lit up--preferably R2-D2 shoes that lit up.  When they arrived, it seemed as if the force was with us.  Yet, this sense was short lived.  The force is weak with these shoes, or at least the Velcro is.  Because of a poorly design system,  the shoes frequently, and I mean frequently, became untethered, which led to dark moments of frustration for our son, and not even a week after taking delivery of them, the strap broke.  They do light up, but even that was less than stellar. Beep-boop-beep-beep R2 we are really disappointed you or at least your shoes.
END
Broke after a couple months of use.
END
I had been eyeing the real Triangl brand suit for awhile but just could not justify spending that much for it. After reading such positive reviews, I figured I could risk spending $25 on a suit. I was SO surprised when it arrived! The quality is better than I expected, and I have gotten so many compliments on it.
END
Love it, just perfect for our Valentines 50's dinner at church
END
nice well made
END
Too small
END
NO WHAT EXPECTED. but gave me 1/2 of my money back for the issue
END
at first I was confused by the buckle but I found the right way to use them , they are beautiful
END
Too big! not nicely made!
END
This is not a wrap dress - it didn't come with a return slip so I couldn't return it. I ended up turning it into a whole other dress.
END
I was expecting more like a sweater dress
END
Really cute suit but torso too long for my short body.
END
It rips after the second try every pair I have is ripped
END
At first they felt weird bit after a little bit they felt fine I saw these in a store and wanted 40 bucks for one pair These are way cheaper on Amazon
END
My daughter loved them
END
Too full. Color was not as pictured, a little dull. Priced too high!
END
Cheap poor product
END
Seems to be of good quality, is nice and slim, and smells wonderful. I mainly bought this for it's RFID blocking capability. I did not experience the "too tight" fit on credit cards that other reviewers mentioned, they fit fine and snug (which I'd rather have then loose). Only time will tell on the longevity.
END
Excellent quality and it looks great. All parts are finished perfectly. Shipping was outstanding, as always with Clockwork Synergy. Received the order in 2 days and it was packed in a beautiful little box
END
Umm beyond sheer. Cannot wear without a tank under. Not what the item was portrayed as.
END
Horrible material! This product is nothing like the picture. The top barely covered my boobs and I'm only a B cup.
END
Horrible.  Turned my finger green.  Don't buy
END
My husband loves these cotton t-shirts
END
Very bad quality cloth and design and colors are not matching as shown in picture. I Returned the item immediately after I opened the package.
END
The shirt is made of very thin cotton. The colors are great. It did shrink a little when dried on cool in dryer.
END
Top quality sunglasses, very comfortable, no glare on back of lenses.  Dillon sunglasses deliver everything they advertised.
END
doesn't fit me wish I didn't buy it
END
Nice purchase.
END
Received these walking shoes for my second daughter. They run a little big but a great little shoe. They are simple and cute and my daughter loves them. The only negative so far is the tread. The middle of the tread is a little small allowing her to slip if she steps just right. Otherwise, great product. I purchased these shoes at a discounted rate for my non bias review of the product.
END
I am pretty sure these were not made to be worn by adult human ears...the post was too short on the screw on earrings. The gauge of the post for all the earrings was also larger than a regular post, so you would need to stretch you holes as well. Waste of money since their is literally no one in my family or friends that can get these to fit.
END
Outstanding product, dries quickly, and most importantly protects our child from intense sun rays. We regularly use this suit on our child when doing outdoor activities, and it really protects his skin while still allowing very comfortable movement.
END
Fits my 20 year old daughter perfectly!!! One of her favorite dresses. size small, 5'4" tall.
END
I'm not unhappy with it, but it wasn't quality I had expected. I think there other companies that make better quality dual flag pins.
END
I use my dads account to order things on here, this dress fit as expected. i'm 5'1 125 pounds. I was afraid the length was going to be too long because of the tall model in the photo, however it fit perfect, no need to fix the hemp or anything. only thing is I'm not one to have big boobs, so the straps in the back were a little loss, but I just took it to a place to get it fixed. (:  very happy
END
the kid loves it.
END
My son is very happy with this purchase.  The tie is a little wider than he usually wears but he likes it anyway!
END
I love it. The ability to adjust the length is also really cool.
END
Very nice. Exactly as pictured. Excellent quality. I would recommend.
END
READ THIS REVIEW. ( I got the jacket variation WITHOUT the fur lining)  Before you go off buying 2 sizes up after reading the reviews. I'm 6 feet, 195 lbs with a chest size of 42ish (42-43), I have an athletic/muscular build and the large size jacket fit perfectly fine. I was able to zip it up comfortably with plenty room to spare. If you are not used to wearing euro/asian clothes then it would probably FEEL too tight for you. Either way the jacket is nice and light for spring nights. I love it! I might be ordering a few more colors.
END
I love this top! I wear a lot of white and this is so beautiful in person. I am between a medium and a large and I went with the medium which fits me comfortably. It's so flattering and hits at a really nice length. Sleeves are not constricting or snug. Sacred Threads makes really nice quality pieces and this top met every expectation. If you're thinking about ordering this one, I encourage you to go for it!
END
look and fit good
END
Nice
END
I've purchased these before fit good comfortable and they have high back. Sick of low cut any thing. As a builder you put things in the pockets and pulling your pants up every two seconds gets old. These stay up.
END
It's really cute! I bought it for my friend and I think she'll really like it. There is only one problem though, if you keep messing and bending the cuff then it will most likely break. Other than that it's a very unique accessory for the price!
END
I usually like my coats to fit a little big because living in Chicago, you need room for extra clothing.  Since everyone kept saying how small the size runs, I ordered an XL instead of the L I usually wear in coats.  It is actually bigger than I needed.  I think there are three things people need to consider if you are going to buy this coat.  First, this coat is not made like a "normal" parka.  Parkas are usually kind of square cut but is more of slim fitting coat.  Second, with this kind of coat, you have consider that it not for an overly curvy woman.  If you have larger breasts or bigger hips and butt, this coat is not for you.  Last, you need to always order a larger size for any clothing you get on Amazon, especially from a smaller/lesser known company.  This coat is really warm and cute.  Worth every penny!!!
END
It constantly comes apart.
END
The shirt is really cute, however, it is really, really, small. The shirt is wider through the shoulders but it narrows drastically at the hips. I really wished this shirt fit, but it doesn't and probably never will! The fabric is kine of like silky and seems to be staticy.
END
Really nice bracelet. Runs a bit small.
END
it looks very pretty, but the bracelet does not open to put it on.  When I contacted the seller, they said that's the way it is....this is going back !!!
END
Great shirt. It is what you would expect from Ralph Lauren. However, the label marked a different color by accident. I had to return it.
END
the fabric is very comfortable..
END
He's a really nice very nice pattern really well-made wish they had fit my son but they didn't so I have to return them and that was the smallest size but very nice shorts with a great pattern super would be great for summertime.  I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.
END
It's awesome it's smooth and it does looks good too. Good quality, the packaging is so practical and the whole shipment arrived early and faster.
END
Love it! Earings are lovely!!!
END
I received like 104 tongue rings. They are cute. They all have like the same patterns tho. Nothing unique. I like the one that has glitter inside tho. They're cool. The barbells slide off easily tho. I was lying down about to go the sleep and the barbell undid itself. This has happened like twice. But other than that. The service was good. Int package arrived in a suitable amount of time and they were all packaged together in one ziplock bag. I'm satisfied.
END
Love the style however the edge is jagged. It wasn't finished very well. It was a gift for my sister so was slightly disappointed.
END
It does not look like the picture. It has a boxy look to it.
END
Doesn't look the same. The bangs are much longer and the hair flips out. There's also a lumpy ridge around the entire wig that keep it's from lying flat on your head. I have tried over and over to rework it, but no luck. I will have to order another wig.
END
Wore this in Paris. Really good quality - NOT like those cheap ones in the souvenir shops.
END
Ok for the price,
END
The color is vibrant in the photo. ..after receiving it ...looked washed  out.....
END
cheap but thats the look i was going for
END
Bikini set is very cute and very good quality considering it is so inexpensive.  Shipping came surprisingly very fast. I ordered a medium but it was too small.  Waiting for the next size up to come in.
END
EXCELLENT!
END
Beautiful! Love it!
END
It runs very small , I ordered a large it is equivalent to a size small
END
Good shirt
END
Very cheap quality.

Nice dress I love the color and fixing perfect and is the same to the picture. I am so happy with my new dress

Wish material was a little thicker , but not bad product
END
Looks great and good price
END
It's good, really like it.
END
The balls are much bigger compared to the ones i originally got my tongue pierced with,but i like the size they are and for some reason the bars won't fit so i have to put the balls on a metal bar. Some of the designs are weird but some are pretty cute
END
These things look great on my wife.  She wore them as a romantic accessory one evening.  It was definitely a great evening;)
END
I didn't get what the picture shows! I got ALLOT of plastic beads. And very few longer bar bells. Its pretty much all eyebrow, lip, and a few belly button rings. Not at all what I needed.
END
Fit as expected and delivered on time.
END
We got the product right away the captain said it's a little big but it will work out I guess and the sailor's hat is excellent
END
sweet
END
Made well .. Love it!! Bought for 5 month old grandson. Bought it a little big so he could wear longer.
END
Great color, good quality
END
Itt fit me just a tad big but I still love it! Perfect for a picnic or an evening party
END
Other than the front pockets being slightly small to put my hands through, the overall quality is great.  I followed the chart they provided to find my right converted size and I received a well fitted coat.  Like I said, the quality and material is great.  The stitching is spot on and the fabric doesn't look or feel cheap.
END
runs small but nice quality
END
Didn't expect the silky material.  Looks like pajamas. Luckily, I live in Hawaii and it's a great beach outfit.  I'm usually an extra small in US clothing so I got a small and it fits well.  Pretty cheaply made but you get what you pay for.
END
My absolute favorite underwear ever. Soft, good patterns, lasts well, and a sexy cut!
END
Its a gem of a walllet!
END
These look pretty cool, but they are cheaply made. The metal is thin and bends. These are not the best quality, but work for a party or Burning Man
END
The color its wrong, I expected a beautiful pink and I have ...I don't know where the color looks like
END
Cute shirt. Good quality.
END
perfect gift
END
I need the next size up
END
These shoes are just gorgeous! I got them for my daughter's Christmas program, and she got so many complements. They are a bit too slippery luckily she was stranding/sitting most of the time. I didn't have an issue with the velcro strap.
END
Bought for my mom. Description says ladies shirt.  However the sized are for men. Shirt was way to big. Waste of money don't buy.
END
This is my second bead from this company. It is even more spectacular than my first. I came exactly as pictured and blends beautifully with my other beads.
END
Really nice!
END
Love it..
END
this is amazing i wear everyday
END
Great set of ties! Pretty decent quality and they look good. Can't beat the price tag for 5 of them either. Planning to grab another bundle in a different color scheme.
END
I needed the blue which isn't the same color that it shows in the picture. Actually it's nothing like the picture.  It's way to short for it to be for a adult and it lays completely flat. It was a waste of money and absolutely not what I had expected.
END
I was really excited about this skirt, but unfortunately I had to donate it because it was a little short, then I washed it and it shrunk and now it went from almost reaching the floor, to mid calf length :(
END
Got a slow-moving relative?  Someone who seems never to finish what she starts?  Someone a bit fearful of success?  Buy her this.  I did for mine, and she loves it.  Not saying she's improving all that much, but she IS trying!  Besides, it's just pretty.
END
cutest crocs!
END
This product was way too large from the size advertised and my wife usually wears. At the height of the uncles was quite fit, but we found it to be very loose at the hips. So we had to return it and look somewhere else. Other than that, the quality was somewhat acceptable but not top notch.
END
I bought this in the third trimester of my third pregnancy and soooo wish I'd have bought it during my first pregnancy. I'm average size and build and a medium worked for me. I used Upsie Belly's size guidelines to select the right size.  Pros: It really reduces muscle tightness in the lower abdomen and soreness in the back when I'm on my feet. It's easy to put on and take off. The Velcro is good quality Velcro, so it will likely not wear out.  Cons: It isn't super comfortable to sit in, but sitting isn't really the type of activity you'd buy something like this for.
END
This Marine shirt is actually quite nice. On a basic white tee and black print across the upper chest, and slight design coming before and after the word Marines add to taste of art and creativity on an otherwise pretty basic and boring shirt. Shirt is very comfortable with subtle stretching. Giving this t-shirt a very relaxed and comfortable where for everyday use. Even though I do you love this shirt I have to admit I was a bit sad for not to be the one with the word Marines across the chest. Adding the image above allows it to have a more unisex feel, making it perfect for everyone in the family. But its not mine and I would have preferred the other one over this one. It would all depend on your style and what you are comfortable in. I received this product for free in exchange for my own personal thoughts and opinions in this review.
END
Excellent product.
END
I love this purse. I am obsessed with purses i buy one all the time. This one i will keep and use for a while instead of looking for a new one. And the little wallet it comes with is great! If i need to go in quick somewhere and donnt need my whole purse this fits my keys and cell phone. Love it love it love it thank you!
END
I received this in 10 days , not bad especially because it comes from Hong Kong . Great item for the price
END
Beautiful.  Well worth the $$$
END
Pretty but xl to small had to give it away unfortunately.
END
Don't buy it, what a waste of money Description of this blouse is a lie
END
Fit great.  I wasn't a big fan of the material on the shoulders though.  Little thicker.
END
My daughter loves anything KPOP. I was very happy to find BTS merchandise on Amazon. Materials are great on this hoodie. My daughter wears this almost every day and we wash it often. It has held up through many washes.

Super cute and fit as expected, great quality

My kids just took a two week trip to Canada and I purchased some luggage straps for them to use so they would be able to keep their luggage secure and also be able to easily identify it at the airport.  Once they came home and mentioned how happy they were to have the straps, I decided that my husband and I also need some for our luggage.  We are all traveling out of country in 2 weeks and I figure these will come in handy.  We tried them out on our luggage and they adjusted to fit perfectly and kept the bag secure.  I purchased the orange so we will definitely be able to see our bags quickly.  This has a great cross design that makes the straps more secure. The buckles are easy to use and seem to be well made.  The whole set is quality and seems like it will last.  PROS: secures your luggage easily identifies your luggage in the airport durable well-made easy to use  CONS: none at this point  I was selected to review this item at a discount. My reviews are based on quality and performance and are never manipulated or altered in any way. I give an honest opinion based on the products performance. I ALWAYS pretest every product prior to writing a review.

hurts my ears a little but it looks cool. I get a lot of compliments

Ordered a small. It fits a little big.

exactly what i needed

The missus said she LOVES it, worked perfectly for minimum-carry essentials at a concert

I'm 5'9 and it hits at the top of my foot. I won't be able to wear any heels with it but I still like it.

It's good for the money.

Nice. Very heavy for the price. I did not realiz that it had rhistonea when i ordered it.

I have only owned it for a week, but I love this wallet.  First hurdle, was convincing myself that I didn't need a leather wallet or card holder. I thought to myself that nobody would take a guy seriously that pulled out a Crabby looking wallet out of his pocket.  No woman would date a guy with such a weird taste.  I am comfortable taking this out of my pocket.  Excellent build quality, doesn't look like an elastic wallet.  For the past twenty years I have carried many many non folding card holder wallet.  After a year or less they stretch out.  Cards don't stay in the pockets.  I have numerous times pulled my leather card holders out and depending on the angle when it comes out of your pocket cards have fallen out.  I have lost a unused $50 starbucks card because of this.  Enter the Crabby... the entire wallet is made of elastic and the strap that goes over the cards is fantastic.  I no longer fear cards falling out.  This wallet is not for everyone... If you have not figured out how to simplify your life and live without all the stuff in your inch thick folding or trip fold wallet then you should pass.  If you need to flip your wallet open and see your cash and be able to flip through your bills, this isn't the wallet for you. I prefer my wallet in my front pocket and cash in my other front pocket.  When i used to carry a huge wallet in my back pocket it gave me back issues from sitting on my wallet in the car, work, etc.  I can't comment on the keychain.  Haven't used it.  If you enjoy simplicity and minimalism, then you will love this wallet.  If anything changes I will edit my review to reflect it.

Outside is fine , plastic holder is already breaking.

Fits awesome

Really good, I got it for my nephew

Great fit and comfortable!  I really enjoyed having this suit for a recent trip to Bali.  I am a DD and a size 16/18W and the fit was so comfortable.  The top is well made and gave me support when in the pool playing volleyball and racing down a fast slide.  Great color, lining and fit.  Will buy another in a different color.

This gown ran small but I can still wear it.  Not as comfortable as I would like it to be.
END
My package just arrived and I LOVE it!  Excellent quality for the price.  The size is perfect, the color is awesome, it is so soft and supple that you will want one in every color!  Thanks for so a wonderful product.  I will definitely buy more and recommend this product!
END
Fantastic hat! The material is of the highest quality and I am super sad it didn't fit well. I would buy twelve if I could. Definitely worth the price. My head is 22 inches so I thought this would fit alright but it was actually too large to use so I had to return it (great return policy though). If your head is bigger than mine, 10/10 would recommend!
END
I love this Cross keychain!  I love what it symbolizes and i love the way it sparkles!
END
The piece is great quality,  especially for the price.  The item comes in a box to keep it from getting twisted, and the colors pictured are very accurate. I ordered this for a bridesmaid and she absolutely loves it-she has worn it to dress up causal outfits and to enhance others.  I asked for one for myself for Christmas!
END
This wig was way too small and my hairline showed all around from underneath. Also it looked kind of purple in sun light.
END
Somewhat small. Made it work. Just order bigger size if you can.
END
Very cute & she picked it out! She is petite for her age so I ordered the med 7/8 (she's 9) fit really good except the bottoms were a tiny bit baggy. And the tail a little long but we just rolled it at the waist.
END
Not only is it see through but in my size Xl there is nothing loose about this short it's so tight that even if i want to keep this which I don't think I do unless they can get it to me in 3 days, I'd have to order at least 2 sizes up. Very disappointed this was the top I was waiting for for my bachelorette party.
END
Bought cause they look like raybans. They came in a nice sunglasses case and looked great! I attached some pics! A good buy!
END
I like the way the say somewhat large or small
END
I chose a few sizes up based on reviewer comments.  It was my first order with Amazon, so I was not sure how true to size things would be, but to my pleasant surprise, all items for my order were a pretty good fit!

Super nice

I ordered this suit a size larger and it fits PERFECT! The top is padded and its VERY comfy! The colors are nice and bright. I love the strings on the side of the bottoms. The shipping was fast. LOVE love my new suit!!

ALTHOUGH THIS WAS A GIFT TO MY COUSIN IT FIT PERFECT AND THE STYLE OF THE COAT MADE HER FEEL SPECIAL.

Very nice quality.  My son loves them!

Looks great. 5'3'' 120 lbs it drapes over me but still looks good.

good product but fits a little small I recommend ordering a size up  edit after trying to unsnap part of the collar it tore a hole in the jacket

This was supposed to be a costume for Juniors.  It was provocative and completely inappropriate for a young girl.

So cute!  My daughter loved them!!!

About the quality you would expect for the price.

Love this for a college ID!

i like the insoles.  they orginally sent the wrong size on 1 of the insoles.  it took time to correct the mistake but it has been taken care of at no additional cost to me.

I bought an XL anticipating shrinkage as this is all cotton and my wife is a medium.  It wouldn't even go over her shoulders.  I wish America would insist on size standards.  This was a complete waste of money.

We only received one diaper, but I paid for 2.

My toddler absolutely love these! He just thought they were so cool. I will say a cool feature is that you plug them in to charge them, so you don't have to put batteries in to them. I also thought it was really cool how you could change the setting on the lights to change the color, you could also choose whether you want  I will say a cool feature is that you plug them in to charge them, so you don't have to put batteries in to them. I also thought it was really cool how you could change the setting on the lights to change the color, you could also choose whether you wanted the light to blink or not which I liked. The only issue I had with these is about 2 months after I bought them, one of the shoes the lights stopped working so that was a bummer.  But my son was almost grown out of them by then, so it wasn't a big deal.
END
It looks great. I bought it to see what I'd get for the low price. It is however, not designed to protect a rider in an accident. The jacket is very lightweight as the leather is wafer thin and seems to be laminated to a flexible synthetic backing. This is a piece for a gal that wants to "look" like a biker chick while walking around at the local mall.
END
Great quality and arrived very quickly!
END
Ordered a large and had to end up giving it to my sister who I normally share clothes with, hate to see what anything less than a large looks and fits like!!! At least it was really cute on her and my money wasn't waisted, just hate u have to hurry up and try and find another swimsuit for vacation.
END
It's a nice fit for a larger bustline and holds very securely. The band around the chest fit very snug (almost too snug).
END
Solid build but too small for face. I even had other people try them on and they all said the same thing
END
Great box! Made my cheap ring look much better than it was. The sparkle is totally worth it!
END
I find it very strange that this product is being advertised as an "autism pride" bracelet, just a few days before autistic pride day (june 18th) and at the same time is promoting the view of autistics  as puzzles to be solved - would a bracelet advertising the "puzzle of homosexuality" be suitable for gay pride?
END
Great quality
END
These boots are not bad for the price, but they aren't really too comfortable.
END
Not what I expected.
END
I ordered this for my daughter for her junior prom. Item came quick and was beautiful but fit her a little small. Contacted the company and they were very friendly. Item had to be shipped back before they can ship the replacement. Only problem is it is going and coming frm china .Zto make sure we got it on time I had to pay for the second dress in full and a refund was given when they received the return. Had to pay $25.00 shipping for original dress then $25.00 to send it back and $25.00 for replacement. Make sure you order the right size
END
These are ok, they scratched very easily and hubby says they just aren't the same as Costas own lenses.  But they sufficed for the time being and fit well in his frames.
END
Perfect. Adds just the right amount of flare to all of my dresses. If I want it to be fluffy, it's fluffy. If I want just a little amount of flow, it's there. I love it!! And it makes me feel thinner. :)))
END
Poorly make and very small.  Am very disappointed.
END
Great for my brother the history teacher!
END
loved it!
END
This dress is very beautiful especially the lace top. The only bad things about it was that it was a bit too small,too short,and the top is translucent. To my surprise I got one for free,guess that was a mistake but good for my convenience. I got a dress for me and a dress for my best friends birthday! all in all it was a beautiful dress for $10 but sadly it was a bit too small :( (I'm about 5'1-5'2 and weigh about 115,it fit my friend a bit better since she is smaller and thinner than me but the belt did not fit very well on her,it fit perfect on me though)I would recommend you buy this dress if you are a small person and get an extra small. It's also hard to take off for me,so keep that in mind before buying this dress and are my size and order extra small,which I think is the only size they have.but anyways yeah great buy!!
END
Purchased for wife. Very satisfied.
END
Process was smooth! The product was very accurate as described.
END
Great product for early stages of pregnancy! I am thrilled that I can wear my non-maternity pants comfortably with the Bella Band. I haven't washed it yet but it seems to be well made, and I hope to get many months of use out of it.
END
They get wet really easily but they look and feel nice
END
Bought it for my husband because he loves cobalt blue.  It is a beautiful blue and holding up well.
END
really nice shoes, not so tough as expected
END
Will wear at sea!!!!
END
Good belt for the price. Infinite "hole" options, plus stretchy material accommodates any change in weight.
END
Haven't yet worn this out, but so far, so good. I've needed a rain jacket for a long time. Based on the reviews I ordered a medium, which is what I normally wear in tops, and it fits well. It is fairly loose with plenty of room to wear a jacket underneath if necessary, but not so big that I feel I am swimming in it. The waist curves in a tad for a slightly more feminine look. If you do want a more figure skimming look, you might want to size down. However, I have bigger hips and I think a small would have been too tight around the bottom for me, so if you have the same body type (small waist/big hips), keep that in mind.
END
Perfect
END
Good
END
Very nice fabric, thick and soft. The colors are great.
END
To small hugged my love handles

I got the MooleCole Sexy Women's Deep V Sling Bath Skirt to use as a cover up while on a beach. The skirt is transparent and very thin. I was afraid to wash in the machine so I just let it soak and wash by hand. It is short and mostly covers the top and just slightly the bottom. The skirt is cute and sexy.
END
LOL!  No seriously this nighty is Horrid. I guess you have to be a 4'10 tiny asian chick for this to work (If you are more power to you) There is no way that this item can fit normal size bust. I an a C and the bottom band of this gown has no support NONE! its not even elastic to hug underneath your breast once you put this item on you will look like a triangle. Its almost impossible to make a good set of boobs look bad but this nighty went beyond the call of duty to make that happen. *Currently stomping out this nighty*
END
Not bad, not perfect
END
BEAUTIFUL!!! The color is very rich, the fabric is soft and hangs beautifully!!  This is even better than I expected! Exactly as shown and beautifully made.

very nice

The little one loved his shoes!
END
It's that cheap material but still really cute
END
Very cute, good fit and the color is perfect with my dress!
END
These were super cute on! Wish they made more baby sizes but we made them work for our baby. Definitely would recommend, these are so cute.
END
Very cool and comfy pants.
END
Not stretchy. Skin tight. Not very comfortable. See through. Nice print, but extremely cheap quality.
END
I want these in every color. They don't skip down or get baggy at the crotch. Very figure flattering and hit about 4 above the ankle. For reference, Im 56, 145 lbs. and wear a size 4. I buy these in a medium. Not see-through. Perfect for any exercise and incredibly comfortable for lounging. Looooooove these pants.
END
Too Big for my little girl
END
Outstanding quality and graphics
END
I was deeply impressed! Not only was the product way early, but its colors were very Vibrant! Very pleasantly surprised, I definitely recommend this product! The only downside is that there is no step for me to hook it to, but that doesn't bother me at all.
END
Great
END
Pretty dress
END
Pants fit 2 sizes to big for my 1 year. Maybe next year for this product if I can't have then altered.
END
It is a great fit, stays on, super cute, and blocks the sun from her eyes, and keeps her little head safe
END
Chain is very delicaate and fine.  So fine you can't see the chain on my arm.  But worth the money.  Will pass it on to my granddaughter/
END
cute top - I will wear it for tennis...
END
I've been wearing these for years and I love them.
END
Surprisingly secure for being pieces of plastic covered in fleece! It took me a minute to get the "snapping motion" down, but they stay in place pretty well now. I'm not sure if these could withstand temperatures far up North, but they're fine for the Mid-Atlantic during normal winters...Polar Vortex excluded, of course.
END
Didn't fit as size chart said and the material was cheap
END
These are the only baby mittens worth buying. The Velcro helps make sure they don't come off. The material is excellent quality as well.
END
These pants are okay! They are cute and stretchy. Not exactly high waisted though;
END
Very pretty and so soft. The scarf feels like silk around your neck.
END
Totally awesome ffit and comfort. Material is really soft!
END
Love every Scarleton bag!!!
END
As expected.
END
Not quite as attractive as shown on my computer, but worth every penny of the (very low) amount it cost (LOL).  Picture is somewhat faded and the "Le Petit Prince" on the top can just barely be seen.  I wouldn't wear it as jewelry, but as a zipper pull on my purse, it will be fine.
END
Poor quality, took forever to receive, and my granddaughter thinks its too scratchy to wear. China
END
Great items as always.  Love my Harley shirts
END
It was alright. The little ball at the end where you insert into the nose was sorta weird and a little painful at first, bt they worked well.
END
Great
END
These are great little cheaters.  Since they are inexpensive you don't have to worry about losing them.  And if you have a big stupid slobbery dog like I do, breakage is not so traumatic.  Plus you get enough that you can stash them around the house (car, purse, RV, boat, batmobile, dog-sled, treehouse, whatever).  I will probably order this a couple times a year when I start running low!

My husband loves his new wedding band.

I have purchased these items many times in the past. This time I am everything dissatisfied. They appear used and dirty.

Not what I wanted.

Loved this stunning bracelet

We received the boots on the date expected, which was a few days before Christmas. My son has been wearing them and absolutely loves them. They are very good quality and look great.
END
Box the badges held in damaged. I wish it would let me post a pic. It does not look like normal damage fr9m shipping.
END
Wasn't the material I was expecting. For the price, it's not too bad though.
END
This is a very beautiful piece. Its healing properties are remarkable.  I have worn it for only 2 days and this is probably the best I felt in years.  It gives a natural calming at peace feeling and it amplifies your energy level substantially.  It makes you feel really good.
END
Love it!
END
I'm looking for a wedding dress and this one is bigger even I usually wear size 4.
END
Too small for my fingers
END
Didn't care for how it fits.
END
Too small for size
END
Nice quality tee shirt, fit is flattering and double v neck is cute. Would definitely buy again.
END
Perfect fit for my face.  Rodenstock is by far my go to business for frames.  Both my husband and I wear them.  I like being able to measure the exact size of the lens.  Most store frames are too big and too expensive. Do use a mm ruler to determine exactly what size you desire.  2 mm can make a big difference.
END
Received item with security tags still on it!  I do not know how this could be missed.
END
These mitts work best for our little man. The velcro straps made it easy to fit his small wrist and they stayed on unlike the other mitts with elastic. The reversible colors were also an extra-added bonus.  We will be ordering more since he continues to scratch at his face.
END
My Dad loves his new USMC fishing hat.  It fits perfectly, is very well made, and conveys just the character he was looking for.
END
The fabric had a really nice feel to it. The color was bright and saturated.  Rayon is not inherently a strong fabric, but these feel a bit more sturdy than many lightweight rayon fabrics.  I would say these run rather small, especially in the upper leg.  I ordered a size bigger than I normally would, and it's probably good that I did.  These felt pretty tight at the upper leg and seemed to want to work their way down because of it it.  In comparison, the rise is rather high and the waist rather loose. I think they're a good value for the price, but the design could use some modification.
END
These were a perfect water shoe, soft and comfy for baby. Fit well
END
Great product and seller.  Item arrived on time and was exactly what was expected.  Great price too.
END
They are really soft and comfortable, but way to big. I normally wear an 8 and purchased the 7-8 size. When my toes are all the way forward the back doesn't even touch my heel and I can't walk in them. They fit my sister who wears a 9- 10.
END
Absolutely lovely. Good quality. This clutch exceeds my expectation. Highly recommended.
END
5'1" and purchased size small. Love it! However if you're looking for a really oversized kimono fit this may not be the thing for you. Would probably be too short for most, but works great for my petite frame.
END
While these shoes are very well made, the heel is more like a wedge, which does not afford you much stability when walking. When it comes to platform shoes this high, they really need to consider a chunkier heel. I was terrified of spraining my ankle just walking across carpeting. I had to send them back, the risks of injury outweighed the cuteness of the shoe.
END
I love these kinds of belts. For the price the value is 5 stars. Almost identical to a name brand one I purchased for $50 (this one was ~$30).
END
Looks Great but did not like how it came all wrinkled. this is a present and i wanted this to be in good condition.
END
Very comfortable and relaxed fit
END
Very cheap material. Low quality
END
PERFECT winter cozy sweater. Highly recommend! Perfect length and chunkiness.
END
Not as expected
END
This is a great watch. I love the look of it, very versatile. I needed a watch with a second counter, which this watch has, so it fit my needs while looking up to date as well. You can't beat it for the price you pay.
END
It's the only pants I will buy and haven't purchased any other brands in the last 10 years!

runs small

Little shorter than I thought it was going to be, but super cute!

I am always nagging my husband to wear a hat to protect him from the sun.  He is very picky about what he's willing to be seen in.  He's always been a boater and since this hat was designed for just that it was an instant hit for him.  It's lightweight, stylish and we even packed it in a suitcase and he used it traveling.  Every time we took it out of the suitcase it popped right back into shape. Haven't tried washing it yet, but it is washable and that is a definite bonus!  Now we're both happy.
END
too small in this shoulders. who did they make this for a midget? pissed me off.
END
This dress is very cute. Material is a bit sheer and there is no elasticity. It fit a bit snug but was still very flattering!
END
HANDSOME CARRIER FOR SHAVING ACCESSORIES AND/OR TOILETRIES. APPEARS WELL MADE.
END
The only thing about this product that i did not like is the fact that it took for ever to reach me but since I received it I can not take it off as it really does hold me together and i would buy another one once it becomes too big for me. Please tell the product manufacturer that to keep up the great work.
END
It's such a beautiful cover, it's a shame that I couldn't wear it. I bought a large and it fit in the shoulders, however it didn't even come close to covering my bust. I know that my Daughter will love it though, so I'm keeping it for her.
END
In theory this shirt is gorgeous and I was excited to receive it. In wearing, the crochet doesn't lay nicely (I suppose if you wanted to iron it it might? I didn't try that) AND it has a lampshade cut that you can't see in the pictures. Unless you are really trying to hide a belly a straight cut would look nicer. Fabric is good though. Sent mine back, it didn't work for me.
END
I bought these earrings for my 11 year old daughter. Her ears are highly sensitive to everything but gold, sterling silver even gives her a reaction at times. She hasn't had any tenderness or scabbing from these earrings.
END
Great Price!  Will buy again. Thank you.
END
Works great

I purchased this wallet to fit in a small cross-body purse and I love it! Is is perfect for going out because your ID is readily accessible and you have just enough room for some cash and a few credit cards. Beware, this wallet is not intended to hold a of your cards! I have a separate card holder for non necessities! It is very durable and cute and I receive lots of compliments on it!
END
Horrible sizing.  If you are above a size 10, don't bother.
END
Seems like a higher quality shirt than most. I recommend purchasing this product.
END
This is a wonderful product.  My husband and I both use them.
END
bad quality
END
I didn't care for the fabric this is made of. I'm used to the Bumpkins nrand, but these were cheaper so I thought I'd give them a try. It feels like a polyester blend. Didn't seem "waterproof", but I didn't try it out. I sent it back as it just seemed my son would be uncomfortable in this as it was heavy and didn't seem breathable.
END
Liked now adding pins to it
END
Looks a little cheap. International size I think. Im used to American size now so it got me confused ordering, wish it had that warning
END
Good Product. Good Shipping.
END
The size its as expected but it is not a fitted shirt like in the photo.
END
It is a gift for someone else
END
This is a great bag fits a lot it's soft I like that u have a choice of 2 straps ...
END
LOVE
END
A little bigger than I expected, but my boyfriend will love it. Good quality and very soft leather. Good gift :)
END
Very cheaply made, not nearly what I had expected.
END
A friend bought these for me after my C-section and I am SO grateful. I immediately bought another pair to rotate between the two. I've already bought them for two other friends who had c-sections as well. A must-have for c-section recovery, on my opinion.  These are designed to be snug and should be a little tight. However, I usually wear a 12-16 in pants and DEFINITELY needed the 1X-2X size in these. I would've been miserable with a size any smaller.
END
I was very worried when I added this item to my cart mostly due to all the reviews saying this suit left nothing to the imagination with how tight it fit around those 'special' areas.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well it fit me.  Not too tight (like in the stock photo) and not too loose to where armor and other areas didn't seem to fit quite right.  Upon opeining the package, I found the foam armor pieces were folded and just weren't laying right anywhere when the costume was put on.  I used a heat gun (hair dryer would work well too) to form and shape the foam pieces so that they sit properly when worn.  I have a 32" waist and the belt was WAY too long and I was not able to use the velcro that is sewn-in on the belt.  I wound up using spring steel paper clips to secure the belt and that worked great.  The one thing missing I feel SHOULD have been included is gloves.  With that said, I went all over town looking for decent gloves, and finally found a pair that I thought looks pretty good with the costume.  They are isotoner 'smart touch' men's gloves (I found mine at Wally-world) that are gray in color.  They are darker than the costume suit, but complete the look very well!  The one thing that was really nice is the functional thigh cargo pockets.  They gave me a place to put my wallet and cell phone, which would have been very hard to get to had I had my belongings in my pants pocket under the costume!  The worst part about this costume is the poorly executed fastening system for the back closure.  There are 3 teeny-tiny pieces of velcro to hold things together.  I had my wife put on a few spring steel paper clips to close the back.  There really should have been a zipper there!  The mask came in a protective shell in two pieces.  I did not get it out and try it since I have an old Don Post helmet I'm using with this costume.  Finally, the simulated 'boots' that cover your shoes don't look anything like the stock picture is showing.  They don't really cover your shoes and are more like partial spats.  I wound up folding them under the cuff and used a pair of old military issue boots to complete the outfit.  So, in a nutshell, this is a very cool costume for the price, fits WELL up to my dimensions (5' 8" / 165 lbs / 32" waist) and wearing jeans and a t-shirt underneath.  Has convenient pockets to put wallet, phone, etc.  Foam parts need heat from hair dryer, etc. to straighten out from being folded up during packaging.  Gloves are not included...use iso-toners or prop replicas.
END
Look bigger when ordering
END
Took a lot of effort to cut holes in a belt.
END
Great Shirt
END
Perfect fit for my 3-year old.  Warm and having multiple pairs to mix and match (since they are inevitably lost at preschool) is perfect.
END
I like these boots.  They are sturdy and well made.  However, I ordered the red and purple elephant boots and received a pink swirly patterned boot instead.  They are still cute (that is why I didn't return them).  I just wanted to let people know there might be a glitch in the system.
END
I emailed the seller, giving my exact measurements and was assured this really pretty top would fit...they told me it would...they lied.  I'd ordered the largest size offered.  I normally.wear a sz. 18 top. If you're muscular at all, this will not fit.  I'm a Sheriff Deputy and I could barely get this over myy head.  It is well made, but inexpensive ($7 90), so it isn't worth sending back, so I will give it to a friend.  I learned my lesson, don't buy from Asian sellers...Americans rarely are satisfied with their sizing, I've read.
END
Really cute and the shirt is nice and soft
END
Made well and looks beautiful.
END
Love it; didn't realize the size difference between the first one I ordered and returned.  This is just like a regular sized purse.  Can use it anytime.  The other one...not so much.
END
very nice
END
I bought this for my mom, it was too small... I had to end up going out and buying something else because of this jacket being the size of a teen.... Very misleading....

great shoe. great buy. great service. thankyou amazon.

Fits as expected my 3 year almost 4 year old seems to be fitting these perfectly

I like the styling, comes with a nice case, and multiple lenses. They are a little flimsy in my opinion so may not hold up over the long haul, but still a good deal at this price.
END
beautiful dress
END
They are worth every penny...for looks. The arm part is sort of a spring mechanism, feels a bit wobbly. I think eventually will give out. The the bottom is sort of a clear brown. I posted side by side with rb 3016 clubmaster. And Classic Wayfarers.
END
looks better in teh picture
END
My wife loved it. Beautiful! Well made!
END
Wow! I ordered this for our company Christmas party because it was the same color as our company logo and our event was supposed to be all about the sparkles. Well... I stole the show for sure. People are still talking about how amazing the dress was and it's been a few days since the event. Customer support was excellent and quick. I gave them my measurements and it arrived sooner than expected and fit perfectly. I will definitely be ordering again. I am so glad that it worked out so perfectly. I was a little worried at first, the price was amazing, and it almost seemed too good to be true but it was seriously perfect!!!
END
These jammies have a nice feel and are quite soft. My daughter is around 41" and 36 pounds, and the size 5T fits her quite nicely with some room to grow. She has a long torso and the shirt hits around her hips. It does ride up some as she sleeps, but not too badly. The band around the ankles isn't too tight, which is often a concern for her.
END
So cute and great quality.
END
Super cute! Package took a long time to arrive but given the quality of the material (it is verrrrry soft!), all's forgiven.
END
Does run a tad small, but very cute and soft.
END
Socks are light but support well
END
A little small of almost all of my gang........(adults)
END
Overall these are fine sweats that will do the trick, and very cheap for some colors. I was surprised to see there aren't pockets, which reduces the value for me quite a bit. I usually wear a medium and the medium was quite bit on me. So if you know what you're getting they're great.
END
This shoes fit me very well, I like it. It's also comfortable.
END
It was a great deal. The tag says XL but it fits like the 8-10 medium I ordered. No one sees the tag. It is my guess that these suits were tagged incorrectly and that is the reason for the discount.
END
The size description was for the wallet in the closed position which it did not state, so when it arrived, I was horrified to see that the wallet was way too big for my taste.
END
It was too small in the chest area
END
I ordered this for a derby party and it was perfect!  I had a black & white top and ordered the black one.  I would definitely considering ordering a brighter color for a future derby party!
END
These are so comfy and I love the prints.
END
I love the dress itself.  The quality is amazing...I had no idea! it reminds me of a nice cashmere sweater but in a dress form!  The dress has potential.  But I need a M and I ordered an XL (because XL is my normal size but I guess that is not true in this dress).  I will return the dress and update my review when I receive my new dress.  By the way, it really does look just like the picture.
END
I put these in every shoe I can. They feel awesome and completely revive old running shoes that I thought were worn out. I am a light weight, avid exerciser/runner/tennis player with plantar fasciitis. These have changed my life.
END
So I bought this for my husband for Valentines day and so far he loves it.  He was surprised by the little pocket in there to cup the balls, but he said it helps to keep it all in and secure.  He no longer feels like it is "like a slinky in there" all bouncing around. He said it was perfect for "middle aged men balls" that aren't as tight to the body as the younger guys.  He also thought it "made his junk look bigger".  He has since been strutting around the living room in these underwear posing.
END
Looks good. I'm happy
END
Love these sandals.  It is what a little girl should be wearing at 8yrs old. I kept finding heels and wedges in the girls section.  I really don't want her to injure her ankles or look like a street walker at school.
END
Bottom fits very good but top is too big:( still like it
END
These headbands are very cute and soft. Only complaint is that they do not look like the one displayed on the first picture of the girl. I didn't notice before ordering that I was slightly different. But for the price, I can't really complain.
END
Quality was excellent, Beautiful top, and well packaged.
END
Great look I got plenty of compliments at work!
END
Very short - not nearly long enough to fit around my waist. I gave it to my daughter - she's 10, and it just barely meets on her as well. Would have liked the decorated part to be longer - would be nice to have length options.
END
Supposed to fit size  12 and 13. I wear a 12 and there a inch and a half short.
END
I love the umbrella!! It's only rained once but I got a lot of compliments on it.. I love that it's clear & can see where I'm gng!!
END
Super cute! It fits very well and isn't transparent. Good quality, thanks!
END
You have to have the right figure to wear this suit.
END
The belt represents a genuine advance in belt-design. I rate it "4" for two reasons: 1. The buckle is very heavy. Had I known, I could have ordered a lighter one. 2. The ratcheting mechanism looks cheap. I doubt that it will last very long. (The appearance doesn't detract from the value, since it is not visible when wearing the belt.)
END
Material was heavy; more suitable for cooler climates.
END
Item was not at all as described and showed in the pictures. The pants were not palazzo style nor did they have a fold down waist. I was so excited to get them, only to be highly disappointed when I opened the package.
END
Best thing to get someone if you really hate them.
END
I loved this very comfortable dress . I loved it so  much I just ordered another in peony .
END
Not so happy. Looks nice for a cocktail party ring.
END
When I took this out of the package I though that it was going to be way too short for what I wanted it for but it really is a wonderful tank top. I am not big/huge chested but thanks to taking after my fathers side I am not petite or small boned so this was a little snug in the chest for me and it is very thin and see through, but it fit my purpose of wearing it under a open cardigan.
END
Nice dragon
END
Unable to buy one size fit all hats and they fit.
END
Great hoodie... nice and soft... Only downside is my wife loves it so much I have a hard time borrowing it to show my Miskatonic pride... Go Cephs!
END
Excellent bracelet at a super price.
END
Beautifu hat , ordered another color for my dress
END
A beautiful and unique gift!
END
Very nice,but small as stated but very nice non tha less Very pleased
END
I order the largest size and it fits my 12 year old daughter.
END
My son has been our Turtle boy since birth and this robe is perfect for him! It's soft and comfortable. The pattern is bright and exactly as pictured.
END
Lots of fun
END
Don't fit in any of my flat dress shoes but they do fit in my tennis shoes which is why I bought them.
END
I was a little skeptical buying frames online but loved these.  I get compliments all the time and they are my new favorite frames.
END
I love this shirt and received a lot of compliments the first time I wore it but when I went back to wear it for the 2nd time, the side started ripping apart at the seam. The shirt fit great but was just a little to tight at the very bottom where it overlapped my pants. The fabric is super cheap though, like super cheap even for this low price. I really do like the shirt though, so I'm going to try and fix the rip, but I can already tell that it's going to rip at other seams over time too. I am 5'5' and 160 pounds, I ordered an XL but I think I should have ordered an XXL and maybe it wouldn't have ripped... :(
END
OMG, wish I could get this in every color, love it!
END
Poor quality. Bag ripped up in a few weeks. Not stong enough for size. Waste of money.
END
Perfect beach hat.
END
The ad says it is 100% cotton, but it is not made of contain but artificial fibers.  What a disappointment!  It is also see-through and paper thin.
END
I love this figure flattering dress. I wore it with a crinoline to add some volume and length. My only complaint is that the solid blue cup area over the breasts goes up pretty high. It stops at an awkward spot given the design of the dress. It took me about 5 minutes to fold the top down about a  half inch so I liked the look. I'm a 36DDD so it's not a matter of "just not filling out the area".  Other than this minor adjustment I have a great time in this dress, get lots of compliments, and would highly reccommend it.
END
Good
END
This is very comfortable to sleep in. It doesn't lay flat on your eyes. It is raised where your eyes are. It blocks out all the light. I received this product at a free or  reduced price for my honest opinion.
END
very nice
END
Makes traveling a breeze I don't even use mine for shoes half the time. They make great multi purpose bags as well as shoe sleeves.
END
great necklace!
END
I REALLY LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!! It is sturdy and beautiful! Would recommend to anyone out there.
END
A-OK
END
Very pretty scarf and I am quite pleased with this purchase. UPDATE 12/10/2015 - I have had many, many compliments on the gray/silver scarf since my first review!  I wear it with a silver metallic jacket and it is stunning!  I also have the black metallic cheetah print scarf and it is as stunning, if not MORE!!!
END
Nice quality jammies, very warm.  However, I selected a 3-6 month size and a 6 month size was sent instead.  I'm hoping washing and drying them will help shrink them just a tad.  Overall, nice, warm and very cute.  Just wasn't thrilled about the sizing.
END
So happy not to buy disposables anymore, this is great for my son.  I bought a 4T for my 3 year old who usually fits 3T so I would say the run a little small.  I like the snaps on the side, it can a struggle to get off when it's all wet.
END
nice
END
Love the fact they stay in place and I don't have to tug on them constantly, but they do make my ankles swell. I'm short so they are more ankle length than Capri
END
too small and the seller wouldnt take back
END
I really like them and i use them a lot. However, the mesh is very tear able but that could just be me dancing on them a lot. Thank you
END
Adorable. Vibrant color. True to size
END
Came with many of them having broken chains or latches.
END
Runs small, will order again one size up.
END
too small, cheap .
END
This is a serious rain suit!!  Well made and a good fit!!
END
I was hoping for a slim wallet, but have discovered that this wallet, while of high quality, is too bulky for my pocket. If you don't mind that, though, this is a very good buy.
END
Key hole in front is off putting, makes cleavage look weird
END
I can't believe what great quality this ring is. We eloped and only had a very limited time to buy our rings, and when we were browsing jewellery stores many of them didn't have the correct size or we felt the rings were outrageously priced. A quick amazon search drew me to this ring and we couldn't believe the quality of it when it arrived. We were going to 'upgrade' our wedding bands once we had more time after eloping but my husband likes this so much he's decided to keep it!
END
NOT open crotch as listed and the bustline ran weird. Easier to put on than I expected, but isn't that durable and it was only used once.
END
The material of the shirt is nice, and the fit was as expected but on big problem is the color of the shirt is way off!!!! I wanted the nice mellow yellow colored sunflower but instead I got a really bright orange sun flower shirt . I guess for a third of the price ,u get what u get 
END
Best undergarment I've bought on Amazon thus far.
END
The material really good, love the price :)
END
Very pretty and very cool!!!
END
I'm very small, 5'2, 95 pounds and they fit fine. A little tight on my waist but it's not uncomfortable. Hearts are a little off but that's the stitching which doesn't bother me. Again, i'm very small, I was worried I wouldn't be able to get them on when I took them out of the package but it works.
END
Sizes run small but love it!
END
This is so pretty, I love the color of the beads and 6mm size.
END
I really like these but they are very expensive for flip flops. They are beautiful to look at and really are comfortable to wear...BUT I would not pay this price for another pair
END
The measure were totally wrong it did not fit, too too small
END
The boots are very nice.. They fit good,the quality is very good,the price was great,& they arrived very fast.. I'm very pleased..
END
Nice Shirt - good value...(looks like photo)  - length is good, buttons are nice.  It does run somewhat small, I ordered the XL, fits ok...let's hope it doesn't shrink.  (I usually order Med or Large in shirts).
END
Don't buy this. Is doesn't fit as expected. I bough the same suit , different color from someone else. Fits perfect.  Move on. Don't do it
END
Very pretty dress for a woman with smaller bust line.
END
size does not correspond deceived lost my money
END
It's nice, but too short
END
The shoe is too large. When you do lunges it hurts the heel. The shoe size from a local store is the size I ordered from Amazon however the size or fitting seems to be large
END
Simple review for a non-complex product. Overall a good replica with excellent attention to detail. The pewter gold effect with tarnishing really brings out the detail. Not a flimsy coin, but completely solid solid metal.
END
I got last night.. the date that they give me was between July 16 an agosto 6.. s it was totally on time.. it fits as I espected since I lost some weight the Las 3 weeks I'll need to fix that but that's on me.. they did it exactly how I ordered.. the fabric its good, soft and they details are pretty.. it's just what I ordered I'm happy with it can't  wait to de big day
END
I really wanted to like these because the elastic waist is covered.  My son gets a rash from the elastic that isn't covered with cotton so I ordered these.  They were small compared to the standard size he wears and they were smaller after washing and drying.  Also, they are bulky and lumpy, sort of think like old fashioned underwear.  It bunches up and twists when my son pulls the underwear up and down.  We don't like it at all and would not order it again.  Why can't someone make a smooth, light weight cotton brief with a covered waistband?
END
Very, very, very short. Like a long tshirt.
END
My daughter is more comfortable in these than the native water shoes that she had before which gave her rashes on the tops of her feet.
END
May be more light is needed
END
Not good quality
END
Fits well but wire came out after a month
END
This shirt was a lot wider than other shirts I have like this because the fabric is thin and doesn't bounce back well... Neck line is super deep. Would have ordered a large instead of an XL.. fabric is a bit abrasive / not soft, other than that a nice shirt. May order a Large and return this one.
END
These ties are soft. They fit well and are a good buy for the money. I am well satisfied with this product.
END
the top is a nice piece... the skirt is too tight.but I have an alternate that will work well, and the top alone is worth it.
END
This is not stretchable but it's okay, very shiny and the heart adds another dimension of beauty and rarity to a standard anklet.  I have not given it to anyone yet.  I am saving it for another occasion, and it is a little better than two other anklets I ordered.
END
LOOK GOOD
END
This is a cute bathing suit however I wish it wasn't so revealing and high on the thighs. The mesh is well made and covers the tummy problem areas but I don't care for the high-cut on the legs. It is well made. I ordered a large to be on the safe side and could have done a medium. I'm 5'5'' and 120.
END
Amazing fit and feels luxurious! Might even buy more colors:).
END
Love them, although I've only had them for a week. They look cool, albeit they are a little heavy, but very good quality. I like the screw in balls on the end, that the skull snaps between. It's like have two rings in one, as you can leave the skull off if you'd like.
END
Great quality and cushion at the bottom provides comfort for my daughter.
END
A little thin. But otherwise great
END
Linda
END
Shoe is not true to size. They run small and are narrow.
END
i gave this to my friend and she loves it
END
Omg do not buy this!!!!!!!!! It's literally fishing net!!!!!! I couldn't even use it! Worst experience with online shopping I have ever encountered!
END
got this for my daughter it is very nice , has very nice color
END
very cute! a little thin and short but not bad. Can be used as a bathing suit cover up or paired with leggings or shorts if u mind the length. I ordered a med (im 5'4 145lbs)  fit just a tad bit big but not bad. Came in fast too!
END
Very nice.
END
The set is cut small
END
Sized really small but if you read the description the manufacturer explains sizing so it wasn't a surprise.  Colors were nice but after two washes is starting to pill.  Disappointing.
END
I love all these shoes I buy them for my nieces and firiends
END
I like it but I have the same rings and I don't see know point in that at all. But i love them so im happy I guess
END
Look and wear nice. Fit as expected.
END
Soft to the touch.  Light weight like a hoodie.  Looks nice.
END
Fits exactly as the measurements states. Very pleased!
END
Nice sweater. Fits well, sharp-looking. Soft, nice fabric.
END
Been getting compliments on the look, and yet they are so comfortable to wear. Win/Win!!
END
Fits great good material for the price. Great buy!
END
Great quality, good price, prompt delivery
END
The quality was lacking. The top part of the swimsuit did not fit correctly even though there was padding/built in bra. It was too spread out. Material was uncomfortable, although the style was cute. It just did not fit or flatter my body type.
END
Gave 4 because fabric frays a lot
END
This dress is not what I expected. The sizing was slightly smaller. It's not the gorgeous dress the advertise. It looks like it was made very poorly with cheap material. I still have it hanging in the closet in hopes that I'm going to do something with it
END
Perfect for the beach and the wave runner. No sand in the toes, they did NOT feel like flippers and they did not slip off. Many jealous people on the beach asked where I got them. We changed into them when we got to the beach (from the cruise ship) but honestly could/should have worn them as shoes the whole day.
END
These are my favorite brand and type of sweatpants.  I love the idea that they don't have pockets since I'm female and the pocketed pants bulge at the pocket area and make my hips look bigger than they already are. The fabric doesn't tend to ball up or fuzz up like some materials do.  I wear a size 12 to 13 in jeans; a size medium in these men's fleece pants fits me perfectly.  Of course all men's sweat pants tend to be quite long in the torso area but I roll them down at the waist and they stay put as long as I tie them.  It's nice too that the cord is now died the same shade as the pant and I no longer have to try to hide a white cord sticking out of my colored pants. I wear these around my house every day in the winter since they are so comfortable and keep me snug and warm during the cold northern winters.
END
Horrible!
END
I love it
END
I absolutely LOVE making secret and very alternative statements. These socks are truly FABULOUS and alternative at the same time. Totally sold on SOCK IT TO ME products!
END
good
END
Well, they are comfortable.  But, boy howdy are they ugly!  Maybe they would be really cute in a small size, but at a 9, nope--super ugly and bulky. When I pulled them out of the box I thought they were torn because the footbed is removable and you can really see it.  The sole and the footbed are not flush which creates this messy "chewed up" look around the edges.  Also, oddly, the sole's inner edge has gold trim and it's weirdly shiny.  This causes this strange halo effect around the footbed.  That's not a good thing.  Plus, the entire "metal" shoe is not silverish, it is actually mostly gold.  So, other than being two-bag ugly (one for each foot)--they are super comfortable and I'm considering keeping them for that reason.
END
Coarse and clunky
END
Adorable! Material is a little stretchy, but very comfortable and super cute!
END
I also ordered an XXL and it fit me like a medium. And there is no Lacoste label sewn anywhere on this shirt. Not even washing instructions. It's like a bulk production of an inferior product and they decided to put the Lacoste name to make it more appealing (the brand doesn't matter to me - just the style). Returned.
END
It looks so cute!! And arrived on time. It was a present and she loved it.
END
Came extra small
END
After reading other comments I decided to order 2 sizes up from my typical size.  That was perfect!  Normally I'm a Medium, so I purchased an XL and it still fit very well but was looser and a little more "flowy" than it would have been.  I really like how subtle the designs are and how comfortable the material is.  I will definitely be able to wear them working out/running/and relaxing.  I will note that these shirts are fairly sheer.  You may want to wear another tank top underneath if you don't want them to be too see-through.
END
Very pretty color and a very pretty dress. This dress is elegant, yet modest, yet form fitting to show off curves. It's a different look than what most people are used to, so you have to take a chance and walk proud. Chances are, no one else in the room will be wearing this dress. I would say that this is a good dress for an art show, or dinner out with the boyfriends parents for the first time. When showing a lot of skin is the norm, it's nice to be able to cover up and still look attractive. Some of the snap buttons look a little loose and need reinforcing, but overall, this was a good choice.
END
Everything was great.
END
Great deal! Quality watch! -Got reduced price from seller due to low battery which I replaced, works perfect now! Thanks!
END
The chain was not as pictured and was broken as well as cheap. Despite a plea from Tanboo, I give it one star. Need to pay for a new chain. Don't bother.
END
Runs small. You definitely get what you pay for, very cheap material.
END
I love my coat very much, my coat get early. Before Monday coming up. Get here onTHURSDAY 13, 2014. Great service, THANK U FOR  ALL UR HARD WORK.
END
Very soft! Feels great!
END
Beautiful
END
Boots are solid but somewhat cheaply made, a couple of the latches have snapped off of mine. Still not bad for short term costume wear.
END
Great sweatpants but were a bit larger.
END
Suit was nice but sized too small. Return for a speedy free refund.
END
Very nice
END
write review
END
Definitely worth the price
END
Love the item and the price.
END
This hoodie is really cute. I wear a medium in everything and that's what I bought. It's slightly baggy but I think the sleeves and length would have been too short had I gone smaller. Everyone loves how it looks tho and I get asked about it a lot. Thin but lined soft and really warm. I wear it often. I'm happy with it! ^^
END
The sweater was nice but looked old and the color was very dry.
END
It's really thight and the logo is not even one word is not even with the other one even twist I won't even up..
END
Was very large but I have muscular build, so my waist is smaller than my back and shoulders.
END
Stay true to your normal size pj's. These are roomy without being too big. I like mine larger but found the large (one size up for me) to be too big. Medium is perfect. As far as length, I'm only 4'11... Not a good person for you to judge the length.
END
The hats are great but colors not as appear. The picture shows what looks like 2 black, a light grey, dark grey, green, red and light blue but what I received was 2 black, a dark blue, light blue, dark grey and green...
END
Thank you to the other reviewer who said these run long. I ordered the small for my 10 year old daughter and they are just right. She loved them so much I bought them in a different color. Wish they had solid colors, but still happy with the purchase.
END
I had order this ring a replacement everyday wear ring for my actual wedding ring (to prevent it from being all scratched up). First impressions:  The ring arrived in a well constructed gift box (good quality) with the item securely placed in it - good job on the packaging. The ring appears just as described and displayed in the pictures here with the exception of the color.  Although the ring is of a lighter/whiter/silverish color than most of the Tungsten rings... it still is a grey tone and not as per the white gold color displayed in the pictures.  The ring does have a good weight to it - feels like a really solid ring (as is expected of a Tungsten ring).  The fit was perfect (ordered a size 10 US) - so their sizing charts appear to be in order. Overall I like the ring and will enjoy wearing it.
END
Daughter and family love them
END
Fits really nice. No complaints. Cheap and sweet.
END
The pendant itself is 1 3/4 inches in diameter, is brass in coloring, and has Ubi Workshop stamped on the back.. It appears to be made of die cast metal (the same as old Hot Wheels toy cars) and is very light weight. The clasp from pendant to cord is a little cheap, it looks  to be maybe a piece of aluminum. The cord is a molded plastic designed to look like braided cording. The cord clasp is typical costume jewelry style. I wouldn't put much faith in the durability of the clasps or plastic cord and if I were to plan on wearing it, I'd replace them with a strip of leather cording. The overall look of the piece is great. The pendant really stands out and would be good to use as a cosplay costume piece. I got it for my Assassin's Creed collection so won't be wearing it. Nonetheless, for four dollars, it's totally worth it and is molded even better than I expected.
END
to small for a large, must be Asian style.
END
I'm going to start off with product quality it seems to be built extremely well and looks a lot better then the picture and I would have given it 5 stars but the size is way to small for me which to be far i do have a larger head and I picked the color cherry and when I got it I was surprised because it was more orange then anything and the shipping was horrible I had 2 day shipping I ordered it on the 17th and got it on the 22nd
END
I didn't think that this would make it in time for Christmas but I was pleasantly surprised. My daughter is going to love it!
END
These have a bit more cushion in the arch than the original, that's all the difference I can detect.
END
I wanted an umbrella that would not be easily torn up in wind and this umbrella answers that problem.  Handles the wind great!  Covers good and there are no issues with not being able to see through the umbrella. Great purchase!!
END
Waay too tight. I weigh 104 lbs but these were made for a pre-teen.  I will donate them.
END
I have had bad experience in the past with Nike Golf shoes of running one size too small, I had thought that they fixed this problem.  But they have not.  I had to return the shoes.  Just did not fit.  Very disappointed.
END
The reviews said to order big, so I did. I ordered EXTRA LARGE. I'm almost ALWAYS a Medium or 8-12 depending on brand. When I wear it, it fits fine except on the waistband is tight. Fits a little too exact. No wiggle room. Also **** pictures show skirt WITH POCKETS; ***** REALLY disappointed that it does NOT HAVE ANY POCKETS!!! More disappointed with that, than tight waistband. Almost wanted to return because of that final factor.
END
Very comfortable and matches my size perfectly. Great purchase
END
I had them now for about two months, and they are good. As described by many, the quality of the silver, the thickness of the wire, the closure, they come together nicely. By wearing these type of hoops for years, I learned they are not all created equally. I  wear only these size silver hoop earrings, year around. For many years, I had to keep replacing them, some break faster, my last pair, lasted me few months. Some, years. I hope this one does. Love them.
END
great yogo/work out/leggings! I am 5' 12p, The Lg fit great w/a little crop so it's great with flops/flats and working out. I love them at leggings since they don't have a shine and are not see through, very thick. Although, they had a weird smell that went away after a few washes.
END
This watch is exactly what I was looking for. It is small, keeps accurate time, and is surviving daily use. The chain is long and thin and hasn't caused any reaction (my skin usually has an allergic reaction to cheap metals). The watch hangs down to about mid chest with the chain that comes with. I didn't particularly buy this watch for the Alice in Wonderland theme, more just needed a small watch on a chain, but small decorative tea cup and the designs on watch are cute.
END
Fits great, comfortable, and looks great too. I'm pear-shaped so it's so nice to have a suit that flatters both the top and bottom! It felt great swimming in it the other day as well.
END
Not worth your money by any means. Not anything like picture. It's not knitted it's a Cotten Material.
END
I got these for my son and they are so well made, I use them for clothes!
END
I originally bought this purse because I liked the style and it was a very fair price. I was very pleased with the quality of the material and how comfortable it was to wear on my shoulder! This purse is a must have for my word robe because of its neutral color that matches just about anything. It can also easily fit everything I need on a day to day basis. I would absolutely recommend this purse and purchase again. I have so far purchased two and love them both!
END
I love this ring so much that I bought three of them! The color is very close to white gold-it is a bit darker, but not as dark as regular tungsten. This ring has a lovely shine. It feels smooth and fits great! No worries about scratching it like you do with real gold. I like the 4mm-but I also got the 5mm. I think both are nice for my slim fingers. Overall this is a fantastic buy-a lifetime ring at a great price. I'm happy! :)

This is a cute hat.  Although "winter white ivory" is really more like "tan/brown".  I guess the person in charge of naming/describing items was drinking that day!  :)  Really, it's no big deal as at least it's a neutral color.  I wish this was fleeced-lined and I thought it was, but guess I should have know for the price it wouldn't be.  I like this hat and am keeping it.
END
Class all the way
END
So worth the extra shipping time!  great design my 9 year old SW fan loves, but not scratchy polyester like most character pj's....the 100% cotton is SO soft and washes beautifully!  Great purchase all around!
END
It runs big. It looked big in picture so I ordered a size too small. And it is see through! I had to purchase an additional outfit from a local store to wear beneath it. If I wasn't going on vacation, and turn around time was not an issue I would return it.
END
This brand has been around a long time and you can count on good quality merchandise.  Held up well with no rips or stitching problems!
END
I read the reviews, and knew it would be small... But it was SO small, I couldn't even get over my thighs (5'2, 110lbs, small and petite). Would of fit perfectly if the zipper actually went down all the way, but it's sewed off. Poorly constructed.
END
I absolutely love this purse! It is deep and very roomy and has lots of little pockets. It came here earlier than expected, so that is an added bonus too. The only thing I would change is the zipper, I think that could have been made better.
END
Although the material was high quality the color of this sweater is not as pictured. I returned this item because it is gray and tan, not a solid tan. I also had to request my return with the seller then pay for the return shipping. I regret making this purchase and it was difficult to make the return. I do not recommend making a purchase from this seller.
END
Fit ok at first. After the first wash in cold water and drying them low. They shrunk big time.
END
Too much unused space..Cannot unclapse when ready to remove.
END
Love the design, cute and attractive. The orange color is nice for the holiday. The quality is good, material is soft. I would buy other clothes from this brand next time.
END
Excellent Product. Fast Shipping
END
Love it
END
Very nice. A little bling that ice breaks for those interested
END
amazing outfit great quality
END
It is nice and sexy, comfortable and fit as expected. I just love it.
END
Fits perfectly and is so comfortable. It's also not too short which is awesome.
END
I loved the ring, customer service was great. Spoke to Joseph, he was so helpful
END
These shirts are luxuriously soft. The fabric is a little thin, but I live in a warm climate and only wear them as undershirts. They are much softer than the Hanes shirts I bought recently. I will buy only these from now on.
END
I bought these earrings for a friend of mine because I saw them on her wish list. I wasn't sure about them as a gift but I figured if she put them on her list she must want them! Unfortunately I forgot that they do not come Amazon Prime so her birthday get together came before the present! I haven't given them to her yet, but I know she is going to love them. The picture doesn't do them justice. They are slightly bigger than the pictures shows and the gems are brighter. As soon as I opened them I realized that this present is going to be a win. Very, very happy with this purchase :)
END
Look ok for the price, first time purchase, too soon to review
END
The lines don't really show up unless there is a bright light on them. But other than that they are perfect. They are very true to size and are comfortable the first time you put them on.
END
Beautiful shade of red.  Plenty of room for checkbook, wallet, cell phone, lipstick, keys, and pens.  Cute little pouch.
END
As pictured but it does not hold IPhone 7 Plus. This is the only reason why I bought this purse.
END
I love the color and style. Its really pretty!!!!
END
Nice shoes, fit good
END
Had bought these Tee's before and wore them out so was time to replace since they were a good fit and quality.
END
I usually do not like to return items, but the size of the jackets run too small.  I tried to have it send back and get another one of a bigger size, but the seller said the shipping was too expensive and just to give it to someone else as a gift.  I was disappointed at myself for trusting that the product was going to be as described in the picture.
END
Provides good arch support
END
Too short. Gonna show all the goods! Sequins fall off with every change.
END
This dress is not a mini  - dress like we were expecting , Iis very long and for a  5""3 woman  a small size is still like a large one . We went to a Tayloring store to make it smaller and it worked . They cut off almost half of the long skirt area and make look like a real  mini skirt and we were so happy , the only problem was we spend twice the price  the dress cost just for make it look like the real mini skirt we were expecting , still the price is good and the dress is beautifull and good quality .
END
Got lots of complements !!
END
Thin material. Cute fit.
END
I used to have a shirt like this and loved it for summer. This is similar, but the body of it is a little short. If you raise your arms up it shows your bra. Generically sized, but worth the price.
END
Exactly what they are, just how I remembered them
END
Fabric is soft and lovely. I ordered a small and it  fits and suits my needs exactly.
END
It's only one size, 9 months.
END
My 3 year old daughter loves this ballet dress!  Seems well made.
END
thin sweater, lights work as expected although, like others have said, there is a mess of wires on the inside and the battery pack is hanging by a thread. Great ugly sweater
END
It is very good looking but it is made out of cheap material it falls apart after about a month of use.
END
I purchased this for my daughter to use as part of a minion girls costume. I have always preferred to make or put together Halloween costumes instead of purchasing a store costume. The color was true and it definitely matched the minion yellow! It worked great and kept her warm on a chilly trick or treat night. The fit was slightly small though expected for a baby/toddler hat...and my daughter has a large head at two and half years old so maybe it is that her head is big instead of the hat running slightly small.
END
I got this for my son and he loves it.  It fits snug enough to keep up but it's breathable enough that he's not claustrophobic.
END
i been looking everywhere for these mitten clips. They are perfect for keeping gloves where they belong. The size is more for infant to 2 year old size. The fabric is not elastic.
END
These suck.  The ones I got we're not same size and one was large and other was painfully large=(
END
This is a treasure of a deal.  For the price paid it was well worth ordering.  The color is enchanting.
END
This was a costume piece for an 8 yr old child and it fit him fine, I think it would be a bit small for me. It is of good quality for what I paid for it, no complaints, this is clearly a novelty item.
END
I bought it for my granddog. My daughter loves it & it attached very well to his collar. Great size for little chihuahua!
END
The skirt is cute but very thin there was nothing puffy about it had to wear a black skirt under it so it would be see through and had a lot of strings hanging from it had to cut off! Not worth even $9
END
These shoes are too cute. However, the color was not red like it was listed. Definitely pink! The size was also pretty big.
END
Cute for beach and sun.
END
Its to big and the material is really thin.
END
I have been looking for a small wallet for the longest time. I'd read alot about Bellroy. I was looking for a leather wallet that would hold up to around 15 cards. This model fit the bill perfectly. I can easily carry 15 cards, some quick cash and a few business cards as well. Plus it zips securely shut. I like how it doesn't have RFID blocking. I keep my transit pass in my wallet and like the convenience of just waiving it over the reader. The leather has a real nice feel to it. Not too stiff and not too soft. Like Goldilocks said "Just Right". I chose the black model and I like it's deep color. It comes shipped in a special Bellroy sleeve that shows attention to detail. I've been using it for days now and I'm very happy. It's not so bulky that it bulges out your pockets even fully filled.
END
Love the many colors
END
As others have posted, this is a thick, dark, heavy ring. Very shiny...Looks just like the picture. I usually wear a size 6 and this ring in a size 6 fits me almost uncomfortably tight. I don't know if I order up a size if it would be to loose. Still worth 5 stars.
END
Love these things. Make working on your feet all day much easier on your feet. Will be buying for all my work shoes and boots.
END
Perfectly fit my iPhone, hair brush, small wallet and inhaler. Was great for a trip to Europe where some places I wanted it as a wristlet and in other places, wanted it as a sling bag.
END
Don't get confused by their sizing! I ordered an Asian M because it was supposed to be a Small in U.S. size. Also, I followed advice from a costumer reviewer close to my measurements that said it fit her well. I'm 5'2, 120 lbs and it was big on me. Placed a return order and they allowed it but found that returning it would cost more than the actual dress itself. The dress is not worth all this hassle.
END
Even after my brother stuffed it with clothes and technology for a week long trip to Hawaii, it still fit easily into the overhead bin and was surprisingly easy to carry as well.
END
Gift for my husband. It was very soft and everything looked good. No straggling yarn or hems. My husband loved it and used it all winter. I would buy again in another color. Packaged well too.
END
Perfect fit for my baby. Great coverage. My baby is 9 weeks old.  She's 12.5 lbs.
END
Great purchase
END
This jersey runs very small and the company would not let me exchange don't recommend this product
END
It is ok and will do, I guess, although I bought and paid for 14kt white gold and received 10kt with no explanation. Clearly a cheaper version of what I ordered. I don't like paying a higher price for a cheaper version.
END
Works great!
END
Returned due to a little small and zipper not great.
END
The attached shirt and jacket was on the cheap looking side.
END
Too feminine for me personally but they are cool!
END
My wife loved it! It even came with a spare battery!
END
I bought it to my friend and he got compliments for it
END
It was too small not what the picture look like don't buy it
END
I just received them but they look like they will stay on well. They colors are great and will definitely help identify our luggage.
END
These ribbons arrived timely.  I received just what I expected.  My daughter immediately started sewing a set onto her two pair of ballet shoes.
END
I'm usually very interested in thick materials because I'm skinny, I weight about 140 but I'm 5'6 and I believe thicker materials make me look better specially shirts but this one I didn't like, I expected it thicker. I will still keep it because I love bows lol thank you for reading :)
END
The skirt is very nice, good quality with a black slip under the lace. There is glitter on the skirt so expect some mild shedding of glitter. I would definitely recommend this skirt as part of the costume.
END
Danced the night away, it literally looked exactly like the picture I just wish I took more for myself lol
END
usually wear a small, brought the medium as advertised...Fit PERFECT...
END
Very Very comfortable and cute. Will be ordering different colors. Received sooner than expected.
END
too small. I didn't like the cut of the dress.
END
Great
END
its was pretty not sure how long it will last though??
END
Very cheaply made....amusement park quality.  Was going to give as a gift, but decided against that after seeing and feeling it. Fringe was mangled with no way to straighten out. Material unbelievable poor.
END
I bought them for my granddaughter and she LOVES them.  She is extreme happy with the fit, comfort and looks of these sneakers.
END
Love it!!
END
its very good product.
END
i enjoy the color selection and the good quality but they are on the large side. my mom is a size 7 and im a size 11/12 and we spend a lot of time pulling them up because of the free size which makes this purchase not a good fit.
END
I decided to make this purchase after my old key cap ripped. Some key caps are made a bit small, but this one is great. My key stays in place.
END
Bought this for my brother in law who has goats. He loves it! Came on time too.
END
Given as a gift and it was well liked. Fits well.
END
Honestly if i could give 0 stars i would. First of all, the description said they were made out of HIGH QUALITY Acrylic, which they obviously are not. They are just your average dollar store toy plastic, nothing acrylic here. The pictures are very misleading, and they don't look as good in person. The paint starts flecking off after 1 use. And if thats not enough to turn you away from them, the sizes are off and they are unlabled. Which is ridiculous, as most people buying a Gauging kit are new to it and don't know the difference in the sizes. This was definitely a lesson for me to read the reviews before purchasing.  All in all, a terrible product, don't waste your money on them.
END
loved them They were just the right size
END
didn't trust for larger breasts
END
Good quality.
END
Looks good on my cap. I use to work on the f as well as e series, so green is fine, but I do wish there was a grey version too.
END
Great suit for prom
END
These are thick, fluffy socks perfect for winter. I bought these to wear with my vibram five finger shoes. They impede the fit of the shoe a little bit, but if you like toe socks and want some that are good for the winter months these will definitely satisfy you. I knocked a star off due to shipping. I ordered these on September 12th, and while they arrived before the last estimated shipping date, that particular date was December 1st (!!).  I order from Asia (Japan, China, Korea) regularly so I expect lengthy shipping times but this took almost 4 weeks to arrive compared to the two weeks that I've come to expect. The condition was good when the product arrived, but if you hate to wait then look elsewhere for this item.
END
wife likes it but should of ordered a bigger size. Just order a size larger than you normally wear
END
Very nice shirt for the price
END
Every item purchased from this seller is as pictured, the fit and material was great.  The price is crazy affordable just what you need for an excellent cost
END
Great bag! Light,comfortable,and has a lot of space. Looks very stylish. Seems to be durable.
END
I loved the shirt its so cute but i ordered a medium i got a large with out notice and the first day i wore it my button on my sleeve popped off
END
Perfect fit and fast delivery
END
THE BEST BAG PURCHASED EVER! I love this bag in every aspects. I would recommend this to a friend!
END
The top is a little short but overall it is beautiful.
END
I ordered the black/gray/pink headbands and really like the stretchiness, fabric, and size.  I folded mine over so that it's not too wide and it works well.  I would have given it five stars, but it doesn't work very well when I wear my glasses.  I put on the headband first, but when I put my glasses on, it made it too tight in front of my ear and I had to push the headband back further on my hair, not closer to my face at my hairline where I wanted to wear the headband.  Because it was further back, the headband did slip back eventually by the end of my workout - but it worked much better than other headbands I've tried.  If I had been able to wear it at my hairline, I'm sure it would have stayed put just fine.  So if you wear glasses when you work out, just be aware that you may have to adjust where headband rests on your head.  It's not really the fault of this particular headband - probably any headband would so the same thing.
END
works less well each subsequent heating.  Doesn't stay warm very long.
END
Worked well for our party!
END
ok
END
I really liked these because there were so many colors to choose from. They do start to unravel after a few weeks though.
END
My 20 yr. old son loves these ties.  He said they are a great width and length for him!
END
Beautiful.. However its not long enough to do as the picturesshow and lookgood.. Far too short..
END
The top is cute. It's a bit larger than actual size.
END
I received the box chain before Christmas and it went very well with the piece I bought to go on it.  Quality chain and in perfect condition.
END
They are pretty but the quality is not that good !!
END
I purchased a size up and it fit perfectly
END
Doesn't look anything like the picture. False advertising.
END
It's fine, for the price, but NO POCKETS. I regret buying these.  The "- No bunchy pockets" bullet point is below the fold ("show more").
END
works perfectly. love what it looks like.
END
Really white and I wish it had more stretch but I still really like it Cuz it is long and aoft
END
These are cute but kind of painful to stick in.
END
We wanted to get our son-in-law a unique gift for Christmas and this Prescription Pad Cover was perfect.  If you are not familiar with Bosca leather products you are missing a wonderful leather line, my husband carries the wallet/check book combination and has for years, our son-in-law has the brief case he received for a graduation gift and loves it.  The Bosca Prescription Pad cover holds 1 full size prescription pad and pen, my son-in-law says it is nice because he can feel the weight in the pocket of his medical coat, even when the pad gets low it still has weight and is easy to keep up with, Bosca leather get even more beautiful over time a five star +++++ product.
END
great item and price
END
Very nice chain belt
END
It is probably better to have a rain jacket slightly on the larger size.  The cuffs have Velcro so can be adjusted to your wrist size.  I bought it for an upcoming trip so I will have a better idea of performance then.  It is bulkier than indicated in the write up.  I rolled it into a mesh packing bag and it takes up about 1/3 of one side of a carry on suitcase.
END
Adorable bonnet!! Went perfect with everything my daughter wore!  Stylish and chic!!
END
Cute
END
My son is 6'2" and we were worried that the sleeves would be too short but they were fine.
END
Fit was too small
END
It is awful, can not even see the mermaid.  Cheap
END
Love it! Beautiful!

I received my coat today, and I'm very happy with my purchase. After my last disappointing coat purchase, I wanted something very specific when I ordered this coat. The last coat I bought was not sized correctly, well according to American sizes, and the sleeves were very tight and the coat didn't button or zip, only had toggles, so it wasn't very wind/cold resistant. In light of that buyer's regret, this coat immediately made up for it!  The coat came in a large plastic bag, and was bagged separately inside the outer bag. Spreading out the coat, you immediately notice the thickness of the tweed on the outside. It feels very much like a wool coat would on the outside, but a bit softer to the touch. The coat is a very relaxed fit, with wider sleeves that taper a little to the thick, ribbed cuffs. They are very soft and can be easily folded back for easier movement and more warmth around the wrist. The front of the coat is fastened with both metal snaps and an inner zipper, with two tabs so the zipper can be opened from both ends without coming apart. There are two zippered pockets on the outside that can fit a cellphone, small to medium wallet, and keys, but not a large wristlet wallet.  Up at the top, you have a high, ribbed, fabric collar that can be zipped to cover the mouth and throat. This is surrounded by the tweed collar that can be snapped in place over the fabric collar for more warmth. I was very happy to see that the hood (with a small drawstring) can be snapped off the rest of the coat and be separately washed. The coat comes down past the rear and lands just about my knees, and even with the zipper and snaps, is very comfortable to wear and sit in. One thing I noticed with some longer coats is that if the size is even slightly off, it is very uncomfortable to wear while driving or riding in a vehicle if you have the zipper/buttons/snaps all the way fastened. This coat, thankfully, doesn't have that problem at all.  ***Here's a piece of buyer's advice: The size chart they show on the Amazon page is ACCURATE! When they say that a 1X = 22/24W, they are correct. Do look at the size chart provided to see what size you need to order, and if you are a little unsure, maybe go one size up, but absolutely no more than that!  I was intentionally looking for a larger sized coat that would be very comfortable and easy to wear while layering underneath it, and that's exactly what I got by ordering the 1X. I can easily wear a sweater or sweatshirt, layers of thinner shirts or tanks, jeans or dress pants underneath this coat and I'm guaranteed to be comfortable in this relaxed, slouchy winter coat.
END
Polka dot. Beautiful and interesting.
END
This never arrived - I ordered it as a Christmas present for someone and it didn't arrive. I didn't pursue it as it was a relatively cheap product and after Christmas was over, what was the point?  It did teach me a lesson -  I will not buy from this vendor again.
END
Adorable. Just like the picture. It's going to be used in the summer so we won't know how it looks on until then. Well made
END
Perfect but a little on the larger side
END
nice necklace
END
Excellent
END
Silver chain is half black.
END
Very soft sheets as all the reviews have promised..cotton..made in India.  I was very glad that these sheets were not thin or rough.  Fit portable mattress nicely and have washed well.  Great price too!
END
Strap broke pretty early upon buying it.
END
I bought these 9 months ago and have gotten so much wear out of them.  They are small, but very sparkly and simple.  These are a great value!
END
We used this for our 3 year old's costume as Elena of Avalor and it was PERFECT!!!
END
Purchased two of these (one for a gift). One came with a jewel broken off, but in the bag. Easily repaired with a little glue. I've rec'd many compliments on this item. Great for the price.
END
I wore this the first time to get my denture appointment and I hate dentists, so, my appointment was the best dentist and I looked super cute as well... I wore this dress with my 10yr old Ariat Boots that hit me at my knee cap... sexy if I do say so myself!
END
Zipper was broken when I received it.
END
I like the pendant, the chain is too short.
END
Good price and my wife liked them, but the diamonds are very... very small.  I would say they appear here 10x larger than they are.
END
I love this ring and I am very happy with my purchase. I get so many compliments on this everyday I wear it! Only negative thing about it, is the fact that it leaves my finger green after wearing it for a few hours and in the image posted here online, the stone looks more baby blue but when you get the ring itself, it is turquoise! Overall, I love this ring and when my finger turns green, I just wash my hands!
END
They don't last very long! Sole came apart from slipper about 2 months after wearing them. Not very well made 
END
Just wanted to say that this was a very good quality shirt.  I wore it for my most recent half marathon and it did a great job of keeping me cool.  It did not rub or chafe.  I did have to exchange it for a larger size due to the discrepancy in Asian sizing v. American sizing.  I ordered the medium and needed the x-large.  I'm 6'2" and 180 pounds with a 32 inch waist for reference.
END
Fits my daughter great. She loves the bright pink color and likes that she can get them wet. Will definitely buy another pair next year.
END
Lovely fish net. I wish it wouldn't roll down much but its ok. I've quite recently attempted them on, and they fit well however in the event that I were an inch bigger than I am now they wouldn't have. I got the red ones in the "one size" since that is the main size they had in that shading. They appear to be made genuinely well, they're only a squeeze smaller than I sought after. They don't have much give, keeping in mind in some ways that is great in light of the fact that in the event that you happen to be as large of a devotee of fishnets as I am and have claimed a few sets you have most likely possessed a couple that extended a lot throughout wearing and hang and only all around looked amusing. These are not super stretchy, which like I said, is great in some ways yet I'm 5'7" and they're only somewhat short in the groin zone and I am somewhat awe-inspiring and have actually more extensive hips so simply being made a squeeze or so longer and a squeeze or so more extensive at the top would have made me a lot more content. Despite everything i'll wear them, just not for anything requiring huge amounts of adaptability.
END
Lovely dress
END
Never buy a shirt from china or japan too small
END
I ordered the mixed blonde.  It's much more ashy than I expected, all one color and has a slight greenish tinge, as though it had been in a swimming pool for too long.  That said, it's a LOT of hair and nicely curled.  Be careful about the length; I think the length is the length of the hair when the curl is stretched out, so it's way too short for me.
END
loved the style. backs a little loose. lost one the first time I wore them.
END
Keep my ears warm since I don't like hats.
END
It was just what I was looking for.
END
I love this brand for my daughter. The clothes run a little small so I always size up. I consider them everyday clothes and are worn in the mud, painting, and eating blueberries. They wash well and last a season, maybe two. They won't be handed down but they are worn hard and hold up better than expected. Catch a sale and stock up!
END
This dress is absolutely goooooorgeous!!  I couldn't believe how beautiful and well-made it was but it is sooooo long!  Even with 6" heels, it is still way too long and since it's a bit heavy, it's really difficult to walk in without tripping.  (Dresses with lighter material/design are more flowy and usually bounce away from your toes as you walk.  This one stays down and trips you if it's not off the ground.)  Note:  I didn't really notice the see-through back and sides (sides are not pictured) so if you have larger breasts, you will probably have some serious side-boob action.  However, the built-in bra is actually quite impressive and holds my DD's very well!
END
Just what I wanted. The pretty colors and the right size.
END
Bought this to match my daughter's UV Skinz swimsuit.  Great quality and super cute!  The little ruffle adds girly charm and the adjustable tie makes for a perfect fit.  The brim is heavy enough that it does not fly up on a windy beach like some hats tend to do.  We also bought a coolibar sunhat but I like the UV Skinz much better because it has a soft tie instead of a velcro closure of the coolibar hat that can scratch the child or rub on the neckline of her swimsuit.  My 2 1/2 year old child has an average size head and the size 2T fits her with room to grow.
END
didn't receive what is shown in the photo.  however have to keep them as they were needed for an event.
END
Absolutely love  the fit and the material.
END
nioce bnox got fast service thank you  so much++++++

Ahoy, mateys! I was looking for a conceal carry purse when I ran across this gorgeous item!  My husband and I captains of the local pirate crew, so how could I not buy this purse? People--even men--comment on my purse!  It is a little heavier than I would like, but the purse is well-made, solid, and blinged out, so it is expected that it is a little heavier than some of my lightweight purses.  I love the purse so much that I bought the matching wallet.  Both are in red, which fits my pirate persona.  Arrrrrrrrr!
END
This is a very cheaply made bracelet. It broke within 15 seconds of opening it!
END
The king of the inserts. I have very high, rigid arches, and narrow feet. These make all shoes better. I'm also a fan of the High Arch Sof Sole Fit Series, the but Powersteps are a lot cheaper. I recommend a little foam or something between the shoe and the arch to prevent your shoes from either pronating or supinating, depending on your alignment. I'm a slight supinator, so having an arch support that touches my foot really helps me to pressure down through the arch, and not just on the outside of my foot.  P.S. I've had a couple of pairs of these for years. They look pretty beat up, but they have really held their shape. These will long outlast your shoes. Don't throw them out! Reuse reuse reuse.
END
I purchased the medical blue dress for my girlfriend so we could have tng outfits and it looks great in her. The only problem was her bust is bigger than the xl dress allows for. If possible I'd recommend getting a size bigger just in case but other than that she's very pleased with the product
END
It was three times the size too big for me.  I ordered the size I normally buy. As well as I used the sizing guide.  It fit my mom who wears extra large.  It did not even come close to fitting the way the picture shows.  I am slender.  The shirt drowned me.
END
The top portion of the dress is a different material than the bottom portion. They don't really go well together, but it would make a nice cheap-looking dress for some type of not fancy party.
END
The fit is perfect. Material feels soft. Only thing I didn't like was that  the dress is sort of see through.
END
Very pretty shirt. I wish it was a tiny bit longer but it's not too bad...I bought a size 12...im 5'9" with a long torso. It's comfy and feminine looking.
END
I love this Michael Kors drawstring since this was my first one ever but only I hate the big Michael Kors log on the side of the bag cause it's bug me a lot and it make noise everytime I use the bag but overall I love it I plan to buy other color too
END
My daughter loved this dress
END
An amazing hat. Sales will be huge.
END
I am in love with this dress. I was hesitant to purchase it because of the low price (I think I got it for $6!) and it wasn't the material I expected, it's more of a shiny material. But it seems well made & it's flattering on! Perfect length for my 5' 8 1/2 frame! I'm always excited when a piece I ordered expecting very little from turns out to be a great find.
END
I love this tote!  I searched on line for several weeks reviewing & compairing totes & kept coming back to this one.  I carry my office work & purse stuff in it during the week & there's still room to throw my workout clothes & water bottle in there too!  The quality & durability seem very good so I'm sure I will want to & be able to use this bag for many years!
END
Great!
END
Bought these for my girlfriend as a gift and she loves them. Highly recommend.
END
Good quality, but runs small! I would get one size larger!
END

I really like these swimming trunks. My normal size is medium, my pants size is normally 32 and following the advice of previous reviewers I chose large size. It fits perfect! It clings well to the body and the front has an extra layer of cloth so that is not too revealing  and I can wear it at the pool. I'm not sure how long it will last as it does not claim to be chlorine resistant but at this price who cares! I've actually ordered another pair to substitute this one when needed. I would definitely wear these  on the beach in Ibiza, just have to plan a trip there!  ;-p

Gift to teenage Granddaughter. She loves vintage/80's clothing and was very happy to receive the shirt
END
Love these shorts want to buy another one
END
Like other reviews the elastic just doesnt stretch. My kid wears 2m and after reading the reviews we ordered a 2.5m.  They were not even close to fitting. We r big Vans fans so we will return and order the 3, 3.5, and 4s whichever one fits we will keep and return the rest. Its a waist of everones time and money. Vans needs more post product testing.
END
Love it! It is perfect and so pretty.
END
The material isn't perfect, but it is very comfortable and lightweight. The top is adjustable. There's some loose strings, but it hugs my body perfect. I have a hard time finding dresses due to my bust. This works very well for me and what i wanted. This is a large, the dark brown. I notmally wear large clothes.
END
Great seller and product!
END
The padding does not stay in place and it's a pain to try and push them back into place.
END
Dress type is nice but it is not to the level of expectation.  If you wanna buy this one, buy black color. Because blue color looks like a school uniform and there are no sleeves as shown in the image.
END
I rated this ring 4 stars because I liked it But the band was very thin and It already looks old and I have only had it for a couple weeks. scratches easily. but it is cute and I still wear it when I go to church.
END
I Love this purse! It has the feel of glove leather,and looks fancy but, doesn't have a high price. I recommend it very highly!
END
I love this hat!  I had bought it for my daughter as an infant and now that it's too small I just bought the same one in the next size up!  It has a nice large brim, it's light weight and looks adorable on.
END
Nice scarf for the money
END
I love this ring! It is a perfect fit, and was shipped to me so swiftly. Would definitely order from MJ Metals Jewelry in the future
END
They fit nice.
END
I absolutely loved how this shirt looked from the picture love how it hangs and the grouping at the bottom. I got a size bigger than i usually wear because i thought they would run small. It took a little bit longer than usual for it to arrive but not to the point where i wouldn't order from the seller agian. It looked very cute from the inside the packaging when i opened it up to take the shirt out i was a little shocked. i couldn't believe how short and how little the shirt was. I honestly thought that it was a little girls shirt.. I tried it on and it looks ridiculous very very unflattering shirt and not what i expected after seeing it online. The size is a little smaller than i would wear but it still fit. What got to me is the length of the shirt itself. I wish it was just a little longer and than  this would have been 5 stars. Ill have to buy a grey tank top close in color to the shirt and wear that underneath for length.  I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion.
END
I purchased 2 Swarovski Crystal Anklets.  One in Sapphire and one in Aqua.  They both fit perfectly and we both had different size ankles, including one really small ankle.  They sparkle and are gorgeous.  We are wearing them in a wedding in March.
END
The Admiral Dopp kit is a classic! Very nice leather. It has a sophisticated, timeless look and feel.
END
Get so ,many compliments, so comfy!!
END
Very nice looking cufflinks for an amazing price.
END
Really nice deal. It's not easy to find a dress with stretch material that is so comfortable to fit in while still remains an edge style, at this price. Love it!
END
Fit perfect wore for the Bahamas. Usually pretty hesitant about buying bathing suits from Amazon but this was the perfect fit ! I usually wear a medium and i ordered that size and it fit pretty smug. I'm about 5'1, 125 pounds!
END
Most comfortable shoes I have ever owned
END
I was looking for a specific look for a photo-shoot theme, however they did not fit or flatter as I expected. Sadly, they seem to look as awkward as they do in the photo shown... I am a size 6 in womens and I ordered a medium, and they were STILL too small! very strange! I'd order a size up if you want that classic flowing look.
END
Cheap looking. Sent it back.
END
These are my daughters first pairs of earings, since having her ears pierced and she absolutely loves them!
END
Seller sent with sensor.  Not made as well as expected.
END
Price is right, can't beat it! The hat's a good fit and the service is impeccable.
END
Very nice socks. Beautiful colors and great quality. And they arrived promptly in good packaging.
END
I love them, they are exactly as described.
END
I usually wear a medium and ordered a large based on other reviews suggesting sizing up. Dont! I can wear the large laced as tight as possible, but still have gapping issues. Other than that, the product is great quality. The ribbon ties on the back were excessively long, but Im planning to cut them shorter myself.
END
Size turned out too small and I'm trying to exchange it and it's taking forever
END
Everybody said how good it looked on me
END
Love, Love this skirt..The material is nice and it fits well, but I ordered the 3x, normally I wear a 2x..I am 5'10" and it falls 2 inches below knee, perfect. I would order more in other colors..
END
Fit as expected.
END
the style is just too billowy and large. Looks more like a moo moo (mu mu?). I didn't like it.
END
Love this belt. The ratcheting system gives me a perfect fit through the many iterations of my waist size. My only concern is that it won't go through TSA precheck security like my traditional belt does. Sets off the detector every time.
END
Good
END
Did not fit at all. Was designed for a five year old
END
Love this dress.  Super pretty, soft and silky.  Fits great. Hangs perfect. Great for work or just hanging out with the hubby.  Need to buy more!!!
END
This scarf is attractive, but a little bit loose. A slightly snugger fit would have made it more usable.
END
terrible fit.  would not recommend.  very tight around the thighs and very close at the ankles.
END
It runs tiny. Im a size 4 and it is short and very tight. I would say this is a size XS
END
This is a very nice case, the leather looks great and it certainly protects my glasses. I bought the red and black one just to make it easier to find in my purse. I liked the pink one but it just didn't go with any thing I have. The stitching looks great and I think this case will hold up for many years.
END
Unbelievably poor quality and unbelievably dumb proportions. Just two cheap, ridiculously long chains that connect at a cheap metal ring. Waste of money.
END
Loved it great for summer! Fit prefect little cheap but still nice to wear!
END
A present for a friend who wore it to work. It really had her feeling some kind of way.
END
Have bought a pair or two every year since I first found them.  I usually end up giving away my sets over the course of the winter to people who are curious and then want them.  Are bit snug when wearing larger pierced earrings.
END
As advertised
END
Forgot about pockets.
END
change color the next day I wore it!!! waste of money!!!
END
Fit good , made a happy wife.
END
My son loved it. Hopefully it washes nicely
END
Fit as expected.
END
i am 5'2" and 128/130 lbs and 34 C and got a medium. the top fit fine, wasn't super flattering on the boobs but fine. But the bottoms i definiteyl could have gone up to a large. actually maybe a large for both, but im not willing to buy another and find out. also pattern on the bottoms look worse as the stretch out.
END
These are very useful, and protective.  I bring a pair if I'm traveling in someone else's car and leave my regular sunglasses in my car.  Good to take on a trip or outing if you are afraid of leaving your regular sunglasses behind.  They roll up when not in use.
END
I love half socks
END
These pajamas are super cute for Valentines Day... I really like the nice embroidery with the little love doves on the shirt.  I think it would have been just as cute to have solid red bottoms too since I'm putting them on my son ( a little less girly), but he likes them so we're both happy!
END
Quality for the price is amazing!  Having fun with my new wrap!
END
A little shorter than expected
END
Very cute loved it
END
Really cute
END
its a great wallet to give, male or female, but its great for persons who don't have many cards and cash, material is great! ill be getting one for just my cards cause i have a big purse and i shove coupons, cash, etc in my wallet i have now, but its great for peace of mind that no one will scan around and grab your credit/debit card info from you.
END
gift friend him son like it play army kid
END
It is a great shirt. The size fits pefect.
END
Love it
END
It's a pretty cute but somewhat small for my hips, and now I have to loose more inches in order to wear it... Grrr
END
I really wanted to like these but Way to big. And they attract hair no matter where you go.
END
I just received my Mountain West purse and I LOVE it! The product arrived exactly when promised, and from the moment I opened the box, I knew I got a high quality product. It came packed in its own protective bag and wrapped in plastic. The  zipper pulls were wrapped in paper and plastic and the paper crumpled inside to help it keep its shape during shipping was pretty!  The purse is GORGEOUS! It even has a replacement rhinestone in case I lose one. The inside is completely lined in a really nice fabric, and there are plenty of pockets inside and out for all my stuff.  Also, the conceal carry pocket is large enough for my M&P9c 9mm with room for a slightly larger firearm. This bag is very well made and I can already tell that it's going to hold up well. The only way I could be happier is if it was real leather but ladies, if you like Sugar Skulls and you "carry", you're going to love this bag!
END
I bought these looking forward to crafting my own fun cuff links. I think this is a great idea and I'm very glad to have found this product. They seem to be made of sufficient quality too. I suspect they will last as well as much of what I see on the self.
END
Sleeves are shorter than expected.  I wear it more as a 3/4 length sleeve.
END
Exactly as described. Prefect for jeans! Very pleased!!
END
These fit a bit snug, but not so small that I would order up a size. They also seem to stretch after wear  not too much, just enough to make them more comfortable. Really happy with these jeans, though not my favorite Lucky jeans.
END
She's adorable in both.
END
NICE - BOUGHT AS AN EVERYDAY BAG!
END
Great fit. A little long. Nothing a pair of heels can't cure
END
Super pretty.
END
Ring is beautiful, but very heavy. In person it looks more masculine.
END
it doesn't fit as well as i thought it would, but the design is beautiful and nice. the fabric is a little thin and its a bit tight on the upper arm area.
END
I wear a size 8 1/2 and bought a size 8. They fit just right and I have wide flat feet. I like the adjustable straps. They are very comfortable. I have plantar fasciitis and there was no pain after wearing them.
END
Great!
END
Love this
END
I still have not worn these socks on a long flight, which is my reason for buying them.  But I did try them on...and was somewhat disappointed.  They don't come up very far on my leg.  I expected compression socks almost to the knee.  These hit a little above mid-calf.  The material is thick and feels sturdy, but in my line of work (nursing), compression socks need to compress upward from one joint to the next proximal one.  These do not.
END
This is very nice. The quality is really good, it doesn't look cheap actually. Would recommend this!
END
Works great ! Don't take it long to scratch but it still work just not as tight.
END
Love love it can't wait to wear it. I know I will be putting it on quite a bit. I can wear it with anything.
END
The picture is an exaggeration. The rose quartz is very pale. The pendant itself seems sturdy.
END
Love this dress! Good quality and great fit!!
END
Made very well and comfortable.
END
Great pants pockets cover all needs. Thick, high end quality. However I need to return for a smaller size 32' instead of 36'. Still guessing Asian sizing.
END
i gave this as a gift to my creative writing teacher and she loves it !! i however noticed that the color is a little more yellow than depicted, but other than that it's a great, unique piece of jewelry, excellent for the price !!
END
As advertised...well made a a beautiful product.  Well thought out design and a great way to organize travel documents and money.
END
these socks are amazing they go perfectly with my black flowy dress and my combat boots ! great socks for a cheap price
END
VERY cheaply made
END
not what i expected
END
Giving a 2 star because when I received the dress it was torn on the side,other than that it's a beautiful dress
END
I've gotten so many compliments on this bag. It des have a weird smell on the inside but it's fading over time.
END
Love these, fit true to size and nice quality. I ordered several pairs of these sweatpants, they are more like a french terry feel than a regular fuzzy sweatpant on the inside. They sit higher on the waist so they're more of a ladies fit but have a cute more modern style. Love the fact that they are 100% cotton since that is so hard to come by these days and polyester makes me hot and itchy! Wish Leveret brand would come out with more styles of lounge wear in 100% cotton.
END
Loved this and it fit true to size!
END
some of the most stylist yet comfortable workout pants I own (and I own a lot :). wish there were even more colors than what's available.
END
Very nice but unrealistic sizing.
END
Great wash & wear shirt with some style! I purchased to have embroidered as a work uniform. I've since ordered two additional. They are washed a couple times each week with no wrinkling or fading and still look great!
END
Cozy she said.
END
Just beautiful & nice quality!! 
END
Cute for a small gift, however the overall feel and look is rather cheap.
END
Looks great on. I love it.
END
His favorite Christmas gift! Nice quality, fit well and stylish.
END
Very small even though I ordered 2 sizes up. Still waiting to see if I can return.

My friend's son is five years old and is absolutely obsessed with bow ties.  Living in the south, these are not just for formal wear.  Many young boys and young men wear them for casual wear as well.  They look great with just a white shirt and khakis.  He just started kindergarten this week so I got this set for him and gave it to him.  It was so cute how excited he was about them.  These come individually wrapped which is really nice should you want to not give them all to the same person. The variety of colors in this collection is great.  It includes red, light blue, yellow gold, purple, gray, navy blue, and two styles in black. The purple and gold colors are the his school color so my friend was really happy those were included. He actually wore the gold one on his first day of school. It was a real hit because who doesn't love a sharp dressed kindergartner?  They all have subtle white polka dots except for the navy, red and one of the blacks which have polka dots that are the same color as the bow tie.  They bow ties are pre-tied and made of a nice quality polyester.  The neck band is adjustable on them and the clip is easy to open and close.  He can even do it himself.  These ties are just perfect for his age and size.  They are made really well and I am so happy they liked them. I purchased these bow ties at a discount or free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  These are so darn cute.
END
I love it.
END
Love it
END
It was ok... the sleeves weren't long enough... abit tight...
END
Cool design, shrunk a lot and doesn't fit anymore
END
This shirt was ok
END
Fits well.  Very versatile as a top or dress.
END
I suffer from Plantar Fasciitis and these give me the support I need to keep it from returning. Love them.
END
Very nice quality and nice packaging.  Sweet gift item.
END
i like it
END
Nice shirt, perfect graphic, but it was very very large, even for a man's shirt. It is now a night shirt, unfortunately.
END
The cup of the bra is closer to an A where as the band is closer to a 38. I'm a 36 C and this bra is too small in the cup and way too large around. Very ill fitting 
END
I was so excited to get my necklace only to open the package and NOTHING was in there!! What the heck lol.
END
Perfect size and easy to put in (my husband helped) The heart looks really pretty and I don't even know its there!
END
Cute
END
I love the snow tiger sequin dress from Anna-Kaci and was hoping there would be more like it in more new cuter or other beautiful prints, and I felt the urge to get this when I saw this cute king panda dress! And I'm glad I got it because it's really cute and great quality! It looks really good with black thin or thick cardigan and black combat boots. Leggings can be added for extra layering but since I'm 5'3ft, I find it unnecessary since I'm this is already long enough for me. It stop about mid tight/below my fingertips, so it's good length.^^ N I wear 34DD bra size 28'waist. Great dress and measurements are very accurate! Thanks! Oh but I would like to add I did find some loose strings, so please sew it nicer next time, thanks!
END
It's heave
END
nice quality.  Must be made of horse hide.  holds all my cards
END
I got this in the size I normally wear. I thought that it may run a little small. It runs very small. I did not keep it. I gave it to my friend who is 4' 11' and wears a size 4. I am 5' 7" and wear a size 16 in bottoms and 38" under bust. There was about a 12" gap on my back. The first problem was that even if the waste would have been fine, the halter would not work. The halter was so short that it was over my breast. The halter collar is not adjustable. Now, I gave it 4 stars because it is cute and sexy as hell. If I would have had a better size, I would have still kept it and made the halter adjustable. I liked how it was made and seemed durable enough. If you could be confident in the size you choose you would like this. Choose wisely and enjoy.
END
like the pocket above the sock.  problem without the sock is that the heat things shift otherwise.  I bought these for my fathers stocking for Christmas because he always has cold feet.
END
Overall I'm a super happy with these leggings. Did my workout today in them and they held up well. Super thick and and stretchy, no issues with you booty showing through when you bend over during deadlifts or squats. Only sad part is they are super short if you are a tall girl these will be highwaters. I'm 5'8" and athletic build (meaning I have leg muscles and booty) and they ride about halfway between my ankle and calf. Will order other styles because I think they are a great product.
END
awesome
END
Very pleased with my purchase!
END
These fleece eat mitts are absolutely fabulous!  I just slip them on my ears and off I go!  I keep them in my winter coat and I absolutely love them.  I can wear my hair up or down with the ear mitts and they do not interfere at all.  A great purchase!
END
Love that I don't have to use disposable swim diapers.  Beautiful pattern and love the ruffles in the back.  The snaps on the side are so nice when removing it when its wet.  My daughter is 16 months old and 23 lbs. and I had to get the 3T size and it is still snug and leaves red marks and the leg openings, hasn't been too much of an issue as she's not in them for more than 1-2 hours.
END
It was larger than the normal flex fit hats we usually buy
END
Look good and the price was right.
END
I got these for my daughter. She plays sports and wears them constantly. She is playing volleyball for the school team. These are made from cotton. They are soft to the touch. They are true to size. They do not shrink when you wash them. They hold well and are made very well. They stretch nicely. Three come in the package, one blue, one white and one pinstripe. The pinstripe is the cutest but the white is the most versatile. The elastic is a very good quality. It stretches and rebounds very nicely. The razorback straps on these bras are awesome! Those straps make it to where you can wear anything with these bras except off the shoulder shirts/dresses. These bras are extremely comfortable. They make you feel as if you do not have a bra on. I received these at a discount for my honest unbiased review.
END
Better than I expected, the quality is superb, I  bought this for my mom which was a long overdue purchase because of the quality and reviews of some  that were available on other websites. Thank you so very much
END
My daughter loves it! She is a scientist/inventor for a school project and worried she couldn't find a mini-lab coat, but this was perfect!
END
Light weight with a large enough brim to provide good shade but not block baby's view. It does run large, ordered the newborn (0-6 month) size for my 10 month old whose head is 80% and it fits her great and will fit throughout the summer.
END
I love this top.  It fits great, the order was expediently carried out.  I've had a lot of compliments on this shirt.
END
The dress is so comfortable that I bought two in different colors.
END
The Hat I received looked nothing like the hat shown.  Small and thin, not even oversized.
END
Shipped fast and looks exactly like pic. Love the convenience of just carrying my keys and phone into places without a big purse!
END
I really like this item it is the third one I have bought so I have 3 different colors and two of the wallets
END
It's very lose fit almost like a pajama shirt. The sizes are deceiving. The only cool thing is the graphic.
END
I love the ring, just was too big
END
Beautiful scarf my daughter absolutely loved it highly recommend this product and the seller
END
Quick delivery.  It's a good comfortable fit as the inside is slightly domed.  The tungsten carbide material is very hard so it will be very resistent to scratches for years to come and stay good looking.
END
One of the things that I love about summer is being in the water and just sitting around relaxing be a pool or lake. Being a thicker girl there are times especially if I am somewhere that has a lot of people that I don't feel comfortable being in my bathing suit cause of looky loos and being a little self-conscious about the extra pounds that I carry around with me.    First thing is first, now I know that I am a bigger girl and that my suits run a little bigger but to be able to get a suit that fit me I had to get a 7X.I usually wear a XL, now I know that this is a different sizing measurement but that already made me sad and made my heart hurt. Once I got over the fact that I had to order such a bigger size everything else was great. One of the things that I have a harder time with when it comes to nothing suits is the mid-section. Bathing suits are made to be worn tight so I am usually wearing a towel or shorts to cover up that larger portion of my body. This suit that wasn't needed, with the mesh like material that is on the suit it covers enough of my mid-section that I feel comfortable enough that I can go without a cover-up. Another problem that I have with bathing suits is that I have a shorter torso so some bathing suits seem a little large when it comes to length, this suit seemed to be almost perfect in that area. The straps of the suit didn't fall off nor did they dig into my shoulders making it uncomfortable (the last thing I want to do is be uncomfortable when I am trying to relax.) Being a bigger chested girl I always worry about how the cups of bathing suits will fit me. The cups fit perfectly and didn't cut the circulation off to the girls all while still supporting them. The cut of this bathing suit is great cause the bottom portion of the bathing suit looks like a pair of boy shorts, this is great for someone like me that wants that bigger portion of her body to be nice and covered.    I really do enjoy this bathing suit. The way that the bathing suit is built almost can be mistaken for a shorter dress. If you are one that wants to be a little bit more covered up while still having a good time in or by the water, then this would be perfect. The suit does great in the water and dries as quickly as all the other bathing suits that I have tried on. I like that all the important parts are covered up while still letting me enjoy the good times. This would be great for anyone that is a little more conservative at the beach like me.

Excellent pants.  Roomy, comfortable.  Seems to be a lighter version of regular types of blue jeans, consequently, not as hot as regular jeans.  I normally take a size 33 waist pants, but this pants was way too tight and for the first time in my life,  I had to order a size 35 waist, which fit me perfectly.  Liked the pants so much,  I ordered another pair.  Perfect for hot hard work conditions.  Moss green hides dirt stains really great also.

My girlfriend loved it

pretty

they fit well, except there is not really any elastic in the waist, so they fall down pretty easily, I think I am going to sew some elastic to the inside

I love this bathing suit! I am 5'4 and weigh 130. I have big hips and butt but am small chested. So I ordered a medium. It literally fits like a glove! Great material and came super early!

I am in love with this dress!!! I would loovvee if I could receive this dress by my prom which is April 18th I would not mind paying for the over night shipping or anything ! Please let me know as soon. As possible please

It was wonderful. The quality was good and it works well - my boyfriend absolutely loves it. For the price this was honestly a great deal!
END
Love the color! Got these to wear on long flights. Wore them to work the other day because they were the only socks I could find. Fit great and comfortable all day!
END
Long but not wide enough.
END
The sweater dress was more like just a large sweater, wasn't as long as I expected, but I love it just the same.
END
It's not a 30 dollar piece of jewelry. But it's still nice and my girlfriend has many compliments on them
END
My 6yrs old likes it , he's happy i'm happy
END
This ear cuff is well made and very attractive.  The surface is smooth and shiney.  It is very dainty and works well when you want just "a touch" of jewelry to complete your unique look.  The price was good and the package arrived at my house in 3 days from time of order.  This vendor is efficient and packages their products well.  I would recommend this ear cuff to anyone.
END
Prompt delivery of product was great but at 6'4" and 220 the pants were to big and a little short. I will return them and get large/tall if available.
END
I found this so pretty and trendy. Could go with any red dress - formal or informal. I was so happy to receive it !! Would request to update more trendy designs so can I order more from them
END
Very good quality! Now Ill need another. I am now type 1
END
This item well exceeded my expectations. The quality is top notch.
END
These medium brown laces match my Timberland boat shoes perfectly. And the feel of these laces as well as the flexibility for exceed the original laces. Very pleased! Note yes I only needed a pair of laces about 28" long so all I had to do was cut one lace to two lengths and keep the other for future use.
END
They are really cute.
END
This actual product that I returned was a slouch hat for maybe a newborn. :-(  Returned.
END
Its a bit small on me, but I plan on losing my beer belly soon, so it won't matter. I'm 6ft 2 inches and 300lbs. I got the XXL. It keeps me warm, which in ohio in winter, is most important. The flap on the back does stay down despite what other reviews say. I don't know what it's made of, but its soft on the outside, like cotton or wool, and its lined with synthetic silk or something on the inside. Overall, 4/5 stars. Would recommend, just get a few sizes larger than normal cause china.
END
very good quality
END
The length of the skirt was longer than shown, and the waistband was a good bit smaller than described, but for a relatively inexpensive item, I feel that it is not badly done. It wore well, and washed fine (cold/cold/delicate - hang dry)
END
This iteam was great. I'm going skiing in march and it will be great for the snow. I can't wait.
END
I am using this prayer shawl in a presentation that I am giving on St. Joseph. I expect that it will be well received.
END
LOVE my purchase!!!! I am an odd number, so I went a size down, and it was worth it.  (I am a 5'8" woman that's thick in the middle)
END
way too big an cut on the wrong grain.... but the sell was nice regarding the return
END
Poor All Around WORKMANSHIP -
END
i keep buying these sets for my little son who uses them as leg warms LOL he loves them though. they keep him warm under his pants during the cold weather!
END
Yes. Great product. I am very satisfied. It did its intended job. Thank you very much. I Would definitely reccommend it.
END
I purchased this bag to go with a formal dress. It was perfect! It's not quite big enough to carry a full sized wallet, but I only wanted something big enough for my cell phone, ID and a little cash. It's very classy looking, and had no stains or discoloration as per some other reviews.
END
Seem to be good quality.  Don't have stoppers.
END
It's not bad. It has a pretty glow in the sun that looks blue, a pretty blue. I've worn it, on a choker I made, about twice and it isn't broken or anything.
END
perfect for halloween costume
END
I normally wear a small, but order a medium so I could layer under it. This was by far my best purchase in 2014. I wear it all the time. I love it! Really is waterproof and has been a life saver.
END
It's great. Just won't fit an adult.

Cheap fabrics. Unlined. Very thin. Cannot use as a dress. More like sleep wear.
END
Super comfortable. Subdued enough to wear to the office but fashionable enough to get noticed--and complimented! I wore them with lace up stiletto platform calf high boots and they were smashing.
END
me fascina esa blusa y sobre todo me encanta el color y se lo recomiendo a todas las mujeres bellas como mi madre y para ella es este hermoso regalo.
END
I love it. I can wear this for work.
END
This sweater is awful. Don't waste your money. The "pink" one I ordered was orange, not pink at all. The material is really cheap and rough, it's not sweater material at all. I ended up giving it to a thrift shop. What a disappointment!!!!!
END
My boyfriend loved it!
END
I recently purchased this dress for my Western Wedding. I was a little nervous where it arrive because I only ordered it 2 weeks before my wedding. To my amazement it fit PERFECTLY. I sent them my measurements and it fit like a glove, I don't like tight clothes so I added an inch to all my measurements. the material was very soft and flowing, everyone loved. The people I dealt with were amazing and very understanding.  I would definitely recommend this dress to everyone.
END
Fit perfectly - super fast delivery
END
Returned.
END
This was also brought for my niece, she isn't born yet..but when everyone saw it at the baby shower it was a show stopper!  It was crazy that her baby shower was a Tu-Tu theme too!!!!
END
This dress is see through...you will definitely have to wear a slip with it...but I find it works great as a swimsuit cover up.
END
Great dress
END
great price, fast response
END
It's ok, got two, however they are not perfectly round, one is a little oblong more than the other.
END
Really like ratchet belts!
END
Well made and received quickly. Great accessory & perfect color for my son's DOCTOR Who (the 11th Doctor) costume. He's been wearing it for days already. Would recommend for any Whovian!
END
The size of it is perfect. it is the sewing of it on the color they use that I didn't care for.
END
Nice jacket for a good price.
END
Really cool looking belt buckle for cheap.  However the built in lighter is a cheap piece of junk and BARELY creates even a spark.  If you're going to advertise a belt buckle/lighter at least make sure the lighter works properly.  If you buy this, buy for the look not the lighter.  I am guessing the other belt/lighters from this seller have the same issue.
END
Cool and breezy and cute
END
Fantastic suit for my purpose. I'm 5'10/165 with a muscular/athletic build and the 40R fit perfectly. More compliments than I could count from coworkers and even children at my kids school! Will be ordering several more and building a collection of these.
END
FOR THE FAT FOLKS!!! If you are wondering if you can wear one of these bad boys, good news! I am 375 lbs and 2xl fits!  full range of movement, zipped all the way up (you may need help with that) and not all that hot actually.  I do get the feeling that I am the maximum this thing can take before some things start to give, but I took the risk and got the great reward :)
END
Gorgeous shirt!  I love this thing!
END
These are the best leggings I have ever purchased!  They are super soft, and fit perfect.  All the colors are beautiful and such a great price..  You can dress these up or wear casual, very versatile.  Buy these today- you will not be disappointed.
END
The first thing I noticed about this belt was how heavy it was.  It isn't a cheap discount store product.  I wasn't sure on the length, but it fit both of us fine.  While marketed for men, it is absolutely a unisex item. This belt has a feature I have never seen in a belt before.  It doesn't have holes to adjust it. It is more of a zip tie contraption.  And the "zip" covers enough area that it really is a one size fits most.  It snugs down to whatever position you need it. No more poking extra holes or holes ripping through.  I have to be honest though, and "releasing" the belt had me stumped for a minute.  I couldn't figure out how to get the darn thing off!  It was simple really, there is a small lever to lift, and it releases it. I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review.
END
LOOKS GOOD, I REALLY LIKE IT, NICE LOOKING REGARDLESS OF THE LOW PRICE, I WOULDN'T MIND BUYING ANOTHER ONE FOR SURE.
END
Just received these lovely pair of YSL earring. Perfect size, not too gaudy or loud looking. Wears beautifully with casual clothing or even your LBD's. Very classy looking and very attractive!!  Great quality from abroad. Definitely recommend these.
END
I bought these for my niece who hasn't made her grand appearance yet. In comparison to a 1 year olds head, it looks like it will fit a new baby perfectly up until they are maybe 6 months old or so. They are tied together and secured very well. The material is very soft and not "rippled" which I am VERY happy with. I hate seeing little baby heads wrinkled from their little headbands. These are a must have for every little girl. :)
END
Cute, but runs small
END
Nice for the money!
END
Love these pants! I'm a short person so when I got the mediums, they fit perfect, except for the length but that's to be expected!
END
Awesome! Looks fabulous on me. I'd get another 3-4 of those but with different prints if they were available for the same price. Nice soft cotton, feel great against the skin. The picture looks alive when I move. Fits perfectly (size XL). Just great.
END
Love them
END
This suit seemed super great until I got in the water. It sags, doesn't fit right anywhere and I had to buy a new suit at the swim park for a ton of money. Super bummed, will never buy again.
END
I want to love this wallet, but the fact that the Mythosaur logo was chipped like crazy when it was delivered is annoying. It came double wrapped and in an envelope, so it wasn't from the shipping. There are a ton of pockets on it though for numerous cards and a nice large one in the middle for cash. 3 stars lost for the 3 large chips.
END
This scapular is good quality and serves a divine purpose.
END
Very professional feel to it. Would be nice if you had a more inclusive tag to it. I bought this for a little girl and took off the tag showing a man wearing it.
END
Awesome quality bra, 
END
This isn't as nice as it looks in the picture. The flower on it is off center and the clasp broke the first time I used it. I replaced the clasp and fixed that problem.
END
Very cute dress. I ordered a large and I am 5'2" 135#, the large fit but t wasn't too tight.
END
Great product... I recomend it
END
GREAT quality! My daughter is going to love it.
END
I got a medium and it was way too small. I wear small usually and I would need a x-large to fit me.
END
The stones are very nice better than I had imagined and I'm very happy with this. If I had concern it would be the stretchy cord could be stronger
END
Good Price, Good Quality
END
It was larger than othe medium jackets I had.
END
Product was cheaply made with lettering put on with a vinyl strip. Made in China. Wouldn't order again. Considering the price you get what you pay.
END
I get many compliments in this shirt, perfect!!
END
It's cute and I really wish it fit me. The description listed the size I purchased would fit a woman's 14. I think this would actually fit a woman's size 10 at best. The color is nice, the fabric is good quality and the construction is better than I expected. It's too bad I can't wear it.
END
So cute
END
I ordered this outfit in a small, and the skirt fit well, but the top was too big. I am a 34 B and about 140 lbs, so I believe that this outfit only works if you have big boobs. Also, the skirt is very short, so this outfit is really only for the bedroom. I didn't like the skirt material, it seemed very cheap, and I was hoping for a nicer plaid skirt. To be honest, I would have returned this product, but procrastinated and missed the return date. Overall, this outfit was okay at best, and I will most likely buy something to replace it now.
END
Bought these for the Wife... i think she is pregnant now. they fit pretty darn tight on her but i would say tastfully tight.  Perfect amount left to the imagination but plenty to see what god gave her to work with.  Would absolutely recommend.  cant beat the price.  The quality is alright, a little on the Halloween costume side, but not bad, well worth the money.  this with a baggy shirt or top.... shewwwww
END
This was ordered a bit to close to the recipients birthday but it turned out as the child was opening gifts the postman arrived and the day was saved.  The pendant was exactly as described and arrived in a very timely manner.  I would definately make another purchase from this vendor.  Thank you.
END
i ordered the wrong size
END
Love this top
END
Rings end up losing the screws and kept  falling  off no good
END
Never really had a rain jacket or waterproof jacket and thought it was about time to get one. I got a size small (im about 55, 115 ish). Usually wear an XS but i wanted to be able to wear a hoodie or layers underneath for the cold so the small was a good choice. Ive worn it in rain and snow and its held up nicely keeping me dry. Also helpful against the wind. Have yet to try it in a torrential downpour or a really heavy snow but it should do the trick. The royal blue is a great color (looks almost purple sometimes). The pockets are zippered and roomy enough for a big smart phone. Its kind of loud when it crinkles if that kinda thing bothers you.
END
My granddaughter loved them, she put them on right away.
END
way too small and cheap looking too. returned. so cute, really wanted some shark prints
END
I use this as my work bag. It is very durable and is very roomy. It is very easy to clean and wipe down, plus it is very cute!
END
this is a great item but it is very heavy but looks real good
END
Please heed the reviews. I am 5'8" and about 160 lbs. Most reviews say that the skirt comes short and doesn't work if you like you maxi skirts long. I'm tall so I like my skirts long and this one falls above the ankles. I gave it to my daughter who is 5'4" about 100 lbs and it fit better. This purchase was my fault because I did read the reviews and purchased it anyway.
END
Sharp looking belt.  Be sure to make a square cut on the belt so it will be easier to align the belt to the buckle when you fasten them together.  I really like being able to adjust the belt to perfect comfort.
END
Great
END
Much better arch support compared to what shoes come with. Helped reduce heal pain too.
END
Very Cheaply made
END
not good; don't buy
END
This is a beautiful necklace that isn't even half the price of another higher priced jewelry item I purchased and it is twice as nice! i got so many compliments while wearing it the fist day and I wore it to a job interview and guess what- I got the job interview! I have been so very upset with some of the items I have ordered off amazon from unknown sellers because of quality and how easily some things break! I have worn this necklace at least ten times and it has held up well. It isn't cheap looking and I get more compliments while wearing it than my other more expensive necklaces. The color is just like the picture and it is quite attractive on. I chose to receive this product at a discount for a special promotion. My review, my opinion and experience is honest and 100% genuine and if anyone would like to message me about it- I am open to answering questions as open and honestly as I can!
END
My wife liked it enough she is buying other suits.
END
Just as other reviews, the product works well, does not roll up, but it is VERY tight in the armpits. I wore it a few times but would rather go without due to the pain it causes.
END
Great hat and fast delivery.
END
Love these! Very comfortable. They fit perfectly. I get compliments on them every time I wear them.
END
Fun product, quick delivery. Somewhat smallish, but not so much that I would order the next size up.
END
Cute necklace.  Kids love it!
END
Good quality
END
great addition to my Johnny Carson collection
END
Pretty, but tiny
END
nice hat nice and light.
END
Very attractive watch,  but too big for my wrist,  don't know how to get it to fit
END
They were amazing!
END
My daughter wears 7.5 shoes right now, so I ordered 8 thinking that these should be good for summer, but these are almost small for her now. I didn't return them since we're going to the swimming pool occasionally, so she can wear them now, but she will definitely outgrow them by the time the summer comes.
END
Absolutely perfect fit and very resilient. Excellent quality and reasonably priced.
END
Elomi fits great follow size chart for Elomi conversion UK to US. We'll made.
END
It would work well enough in theory, if the sizing chart was more accurate. The belt was way too big for me, even with the measurement sizes that they listed for each tier.
END
Good support for a cute sports bra. I ordered XL and it does an okay job while running. I would order again
END
Order A Size Bigger Fits Good But The Buttons Were A Little Loose Other Than That I Love It
END
It was too large at the top and too small at the bottom.
END
love
END
Since i'm a small person, i expected it might be large, and i was correct. Washed it in warm water and dried on high; now it fits much better! But, i still need to roll up the sleeves a bit. Overall, very comfortable! and good quality.
END
The quality is fine, the  print looks exactly as in the pictures but I ordered XL which seemed to be a little short for that size, usually XL tees are longer than that.
END
Love this!
END
They were nice the first day, after you wash them they look horrible and don't fit the same. Way to cheap product
END
snapback thats to big.  never had to snap a hat -2 holes n it still looks poofy when snug on my head
END
IT'S TERRIBLE!!!! The material is of inferior quality. It's really a piece of garbage that needs to be tossed but then again what do you expect for this price.
END
Great
END
i like it but the size was completely off
END
It looks great and exactly what I was looking for as a special Christmas gift.
END
Love them. Clean design and yet not simple or lame. Flatter any face shape.
END
Looked great on my grandson.  Quality material.
END
Love.  Durable.
END
I've had my belly button pierced for over ten years without an issue. 3 days of one of these in me and I have a large hard growth in there that hurts. Had to take it out and contemplating letting it close now. Bummed way out. These are NOT quality and NOT worth it.
END
Worst thing I have bought yet. Not only was it too small but it was ridiculously too short
END
These are perfect for toddlers. Im sure also great for body jewelry but I have a kiddo that yanks on her ears and having something like this keeps her earrings in. No more issues with liars backings or lost entire earrings. The only thing I don't like about these is that the heart isn't defined enough. I shouldve just got the round ones cause you cant really tell its a heart even if you look closely.
END
thanks great deal
END
It is for my granddaughter. They are very cute. I am sure she will love it.
END
These were WAY smaller than I expected! and they pinched my sons feet so bad, he was limping while wearing them.
END
too small, imo: overpriced.
END
Sorta snug but a great looking denim button up shirt. I received this at a free or reduced price for an honest and unbiased review.
END
These purses were wonderful.  Our granddaughters were thrilled.
END
My son loves these and we have seen other kids from around the state in these soccer boots too. He spends all day in them during tournaments.
END
Dresses up a black dress or top.
END
This top is fit on me perfect. Finish is good, so also the material and design. Delivered on time.
END
The beads are quite beautiful, but the elastic is very flimsy. It broke almost immediately. I replaced the elastic with some of my own from my local crafts store, and now I'm happy with it.
END
I'm a tall guy and they are low rise. I find myself constantly pulling them up.
END
the shirt is good. this is the best one in those i have ordered. all others are not of good quality but this is really good.
END
This is a beautiful sandal but it does run a little big.  That's why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. I hope that will make a difference when I wear them in the hot weather.  I didn't want a different size because I was afraid that it would be too small.  The color which is a metallic taupe color is beautiful and the beading is also lovely.
END
It looks nice but it's a little tight I'm 5'2 180lbs and ordered an XL I love the way it looks on me but it's a little tiny struggle to take off the top part
END
My wife ordered this I am not sure I would have ordered it . I love it ,works great on my bed side table.
END
Poor quality material. Major shrinking after one wash.
END
I received this beautiful bracelet today.  When I took it out of the box I was really surprised. It looks like a real diamond white gold bracelet. My husband bought me a 1 1/2 carat bracelet about 20 years ago, he paid about $3000 for the bracelet.  I went and got my diamond bracelet and this new bracelet and placed them side by side. Except for my diamond bracelet being yellow gold and this new bracelet being white gold I would have a real hard time telling them apart. I am very surprised in the quality of this bracelet. I would recommend this bracelet to every woman, you know what they say..."DIAMONDS ARE A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND" and this bracelet can be my friend every time I go out.  Disclaimer:  I got this product at a reduced price for an honest review.
END
Love, love, love these!! Will not jog without them, even with my high end running shoes.  These are great and help with my knee and foot pain!!
END
thanks
END
Great quality, just as I expected! Color is good.
END
Feel great, reason for 4 stars one has a click hoping it will stop.
END
Lovely quality linen shirt for summer! Dress up or down with shorts or trousers
END
I've had these "jeans" for about a month now. Based on other reviews I decided to wash only in cold water & hang out to dry instead of in the dryer. I bought the black jeans. They do seem to have faded some and are no longer a crisp dark black like they were when they were new. I do see some "softness" coming out with little fuzzies but not actual balls of cloth that some complained of when they put them in the dryer. I'm 5'2", 240 lbs & bought size 2x petite. They fit perfect in both length & width but do stretch out a bit with wear, shrinking back to size after laundering. They are very soft & comfortable. I needed something comfortable & warm to wear on a 5 hour airline flight & these worked perfectly. I also wear them to work on jeans-day & no one can tell there're not true demin. Also, the "boot" leg seems to be more of a bell-bottom. Certainly wider than the average boot-leg style but I don't find that to be a problem.
END
She loved it
END
The print is very faded and the shirt is WAY too big. I contacted the seller to try to return for a smaller size but I have not heard back. I am normally a large and if I could do it all over I would get a small.
END
The size was not even close to a 2x it was more like a medium.... I will not order clothes online again
END
Forget trying to get this monstrosity on yourself i spent 10 minutes trying to and then the clasp broke and I just got this! 0 stars
END
Great little lipstick case.  Soft and supple leather and a beautiful color
END
Love it
END
Lovely and comfortable! Be aware you need to wear a tank top under it...very see through.
END
I have 3 pairs, favorite pants ever.  They stretch as you wear them (linen!) so 3rd pair I bought a smaller size and after 15 minutes they fit perfect!
END
Honey Store clothing is always sexy. This is my second and my husband loves them.
END
The bracelet is very nice!  I just wish it would of came in a gift box because this is a XMAS gift for my hair stylist.
END
This carry on is the perfect size if you need a smaller option for multiple international airlines. Some reviews say it feels cheap or weak but I don't think that at all. Feels like a normal carry on and seems sturdy. Even though the long handle doesn't lock it seems to keep its place well when extended. Very happy with the purchase!
END
Exacty what I wanted.
END
But I still love it
END
nice shoe
END
Amazing whenever I wear it I get so much complement
END
Excellent shirt for the price.  Just be sure to go one size up since it is from China
END
Perfect!
END
Reviewing on 6/8/16. I got bright orange and blue one. I am 5'4" 123lbs fit with little belly fat. I got size Small for both. I wear lululemon size 2 for a tight fit. These new pants fit perfectly and comfortably, not as tight as my lululemon. Blue one is super feathery soft, orange one feels different but still good. I will purchase these instead of lululemon since the quality is just high as lulu but whole lot cheaper. I really love these. Im gonna order xsmall next time if i lose some weight and want to have tighter fit. But small works perfect with few wrinkles.
END
I like the color and it fit me well.
END
These leggings are fun to wear...they are comfortable too.
END
I bought an XL, gave it to my thinnest friend. It was comically small and legitimately could've fit a child.
END
fast and loved it
END
This is an adorable bag/tote. I purchased the red bag and the color is true to the picture. It's a lot thinner than I imagined. It might not hold a whole lot that has shape. The bag is very flat. When received it definitely needed a washing and had a weird odor.
END
It fits true to size and does exactly what it is supposed to do. I deliberately ordered a size down so I have it readily available when I meet my next weight-loss goal. I was still able to get it on, even though it was difficult. It will fit perfectly in a month or so. Not the most breathable but it doesn't bother me.
END
Cute top has 2 layers and can be worn with or without the laser-cut overlay tank.  Maaji fits smaller than typical bikinis, but they are THE BEST in terms of fabric quality and cut.  I expect to mix and match this top with 2 different Maaji bikini bottoms--all their suits are reversible, and their patterns and colors work interchangeably.  Love Maaji!
END
These glasses came quickly and were well packaged. There were 6 pairs of glasses in the box. They were just as ordered, and I can read again! They fit well, and they were a great price for the quality. I will order them again as soon as I lose these... which sadly never seems to take me long!
END
Arrived a bit damaged ... But can be fixed... Heavy..but nice
END
It's what you think it would be. The pouch Feels right and breathable. It's nice like a Jockstrap but in a thong.
END
Very nice looking ring. It has a nice weight and the stones look very believable.  I bought this ring to wear when I travel and am very pleased with it.
END
Nice shirt, but had to return it as it was too small. I might order another one 2 sizes larger. It's way small.
END
Cute bottoms, however the straps on the top are way to long.
END
I am a size 16 and this was skin tight I won't wear it. I guess I will give it to a friend. My advice is buy a much larger size I ordered a size extra large  and it should have fitted me. It is made nice and very pretty.
END
Excellent base for edgy layering.
END
My husband is 6'6" so finding pants that work can be hard. With the 38x36 loose fit, he really likes them. If it wasn't the loose fit, it wouldn't fit right for his height.
END
It's a great product. My toddler is 21 months old and size 6 great for her. It looks very comfortable and fashion. Also thanks for Amazon.
END
Beautiful necklace. It's smaller than I expected, but I like it, it's delicate and subtle.
END
The dress was a little tight under the breast area but it looked amazing on me.
END
I love these!!!
END
Adorable but took a long time to get to me
END
Super cute on my great-granddaughter I wish they had stuff like this 20 years ago
END
Beautiful, but short for size I ordered.
END
Came quick and was exactly as appeared in picture
END
Cheaply made and incredible small.  I can get it on, but it's not comfortable.
END
Exactly what it looks like! I love it!
END
Great outfit
END
My son loves it, but outgrew them before his 3rd birthday.
END
I had purchased these insoles many years ago when my podiatrist recommended them.  They worked for me then and they still work.  Hopefully it will clear up my problem completely.  My feet do feel better just in the few days I have been wearing them.
END
Loved it!!!
END
Works great
END
Looked great!
END
Looks great, not too wide or skinny, just right. nice material.

Cheaply made with very short sleeves!

hell yea

Good product - packed good

Love It! Lots of compliments

WOW! WEE! Expression from my grand daughter when she received the umbrella by UPS PRIME! Great construction, Covers my grand daughter to her belly, so it is excellent protection against rain!
END
I like this purse. It worked well for me while traveling too.
END
Love love love it. My 2 year old looks adorable, great price and she still has some growing room.
END
LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! FITS PERFECT AND SNATCHES ME IN AND LIFTS METUP!
END
good
END
Good item at a good price.
END
Great hat! Fits as expected. Huge rim!
END
The price may make you think it's junk. While it's not a high end band, it works very well for my LG GWatch R and feels better than junk. Worth it.
END
Very cute but tight
END
el producto es como lo describen la marca asic es muy buena y no se encuentra en mi pas bueno en cuanto a los zapatos el material es bueno ,,, podran especificar a la gente de amazon q especifique mejor las tallas gracias
END
I initially ordered a size 12, but it was too tight on my back. The size 14 was sold out, so I had to settle for a size with the help of the alteration shop. However, it still turned out beautifully. The dress is made of quality material.
END
Great shirt! Great fit, very soft material.
END
Too small and too havy
END
love the quality.  I an ordering more for my grand daughters for the winter.
END
Thought they would be too small but they fit fine
END
Cheap shirt.  I guess that's what you get for $9.99 but I ordered a size large and I'm squeezing into the shirt - clearly not a size large. It's suppose to be a loose fit like the photo.  Second time I ordered something off Amazon where the size was not correct. I would send it back, but I don't want to pay the shipping charge so I'll just keep it and use it for a rag!
END
This item was exactly what I was looking for.  Space for everything including a change pocket, a pen holder, an id window, and plenty of room for cards, passport, tickets and receipts inside the zippered case.  An outside slot for tickets or boarding pass and a detachable strap for carrying all in a handsome leather.  It arrived quickly too.  Thank you
END
Nice
END
excelente
END
Purchased for a school play. They did the job fine. :)
END
It was not as pictured. It was more like a scarf with arm holes. It was not in one piece
END
I have these for my almost two year old as a lot of her dresses down come with bloomers. I did take the suggestion to go down a size as they run big. Glad I did get the 12 month and not the 24 months.
END
All 7 very nice size, beautiful color. Great for wire wrapping
END
I got the Dhnewsun Girl Simple Silver Heart Love Bracelet Silver Chain Lady Women Jewelry Gift.  I was very surprised when this item got to the house.  The item does take a while to get to your home but it did arrive faster than the estimated delivery date.  It is so light that you don't even feel it when you put it on.  it is very well made and sturdy.  We even pulled at the bracelet when we got it.  The reason for that is because i got two of these.  One will be for me and the other one will be for my granddaughter.  I was gonna make sure it would hold up to a child.  The stones on each side of the hearts are a perfect touch.  You could wear this with your everyday dress or for dress up when your are going out for the night or church on Sunday.  This would make a nice gift for the following:  for special occasions such as a BirthdayGraduation, Anniversary, Wedding, Christmas, Easter, Valentine's Day and Mother's Day - Perfect for girlfriend, daughter, wife, mom, best friend, sister.  I received this product for a discount rate in exchange for my honest review. This however has not influenced my opinion. As an online shopper I know how important these reviews are in helping someone decide whether or not to buy a product.  If this review was helpful please mark yes.
END
Super cute little cover up, arms are a but snug so if you have some guns order up.
END
This item was horrible!!  Nothing like the picture.  I will never buy anything from this manufacture again.  Very misleading.
END
Absolutely LOVE this bag! Wanted something that wasn't too crazy big, but big enough for me to haul extra things for my kiddos when needed. Love that the straps fit over my shoulders without using the extra long strap included (I don't like using those) That was super important to me with a new purse. The smell is a little funky, but goes away. I sprayed some perfume in it and let it air out a little. I was so excited to start using this purse that I didn't let it air out as long as others, but the smell doesn't bother me. I got the brown color and I LOVE the color. It looks high quality and like it would definitely be more then what I paid. I am super happy with this purchase!! If you are on the fence, just do it! you won't regret it :)
END
Definitely small, like I read in a review, but my granddaughter LOVES it! She's in to tea party's so much her 6th b-day party was a huge tea party and this was perfect!
END
tese were a gift for a friend and they were as promised, actually looked much better tha pictured.
END
Came very late than expected, the color of the "jeans" are way darker. They aren't jeans, they  are ugly spandex that make your butt look odd. Whatever you do, do not buy these. It's a scam.
END
I bought this shirt to wear under my sundresses.. Super cute!!
END
I bought this as a little gift for my girlfriend since she loves kittens. Her ring size is around a 6 or 7 and this comes in a size 4 as standard. The title, saying adjustable, would imply that this ring is in fact adjustable. Assuming adjusting it would be easy, I brought it to 4 different jewelers who  all said they couldn't do anything for it, apparently any movement in the band will cause the crystals to fall out / loosen. After some frustration, I tried to gently play with the band to see if maybe it was meant to be adjusted on the fly by the wearer, only to end up breaking it with almost no effort. Admittedly, toying with it myself was a bad idea, but I only did so after I thought I had no other choice.  Long story short. The company selling this ring is based in France, and I don't think the know what adjustable means.

Female here. I'm going to break this down in to 3 categories: fit, look, and accessories. 1) Fit. I knew going into this that it would not fit exactly right because I am a female, but I was determined to make my cross-play come to life. I'm 5'7" 200 lbs, 42/38/44 with somewhat wide/built shoulders. That being said, the height was good with a little bit of bunching at my ankles, chest was a little tight, and arms and fingers were waay too long. I ended up partially "binding" my chest with 2 sports bras and a tank to keep them smushed in place. The mask was tight all around, almost impossible to see, and I could not get my wig to stay attached to it to save my life. I did end up buying a separate mask. 2) Looks. For this is was very simple. Closer to comic Deadpool, but it's not perfectly accurate. The red is a little brighter than expected. And because of having boobs, the chest did look a little strange to me, but the other parts to my cross-play covered the weird fit nicely. 3) Accessories. Admittedly, I did not use them for my cross-play. The holster probably won't do you much good as it seems too small to really hold any kind of toy gun or nerf. The belt pouches were okay, only a few inches deep, and would hold small objects like cards/money, the biggest one could hold my old Windows 720 without its case. The shoulder/back strap was just really confusing and seemed cheaply made. But again, I did not use these items, so I have no idea about wear and tear or comfort of the accessories. Overall, it is an okay Deadpool suit. If it fits you well or you can alter it and make it work like I did, I think it's worth the money as a beginner suit or just a one time thing. If you want to become a full time cosplayer or want something really high quality, I suggest getting one custom made.
END
It's cute. I was worried at first because the stick in the fish is crooked, but it fits well. Also, mine only came with one plastic ear back piece. Not a big deal for me, but just a FYI!
END
The material is very good, it is not see thru but you look very sexy with it!
END
Handle a little wobbly
END
So pretty!
END
Loved it
END
I wore these pants for less than 4 hours and the seam in the crotch area ripped wide open.  The pants were very loose on me, so they weren't too small. I wasn't doing anything remotely physical, i just stood up and rip! Poor quality stitching.
END
It's very pretty!!! Unfortunately its not slim at all, it does fit in my small purse bit its very bulky. If you're looking for a wallet that will fit a small purse this is not it. Otherwise I like it a lot. The color was a little different than the picture.
END
Its cute, BUT whwnever I want to tale a picture with flash it really makes it blurry. Because somehow the little hole in the back blocks the light. Other than that, its cute,
END
These earrings are really cute and just what I was looking for.  Unfortunately, when I received them, the earring backs were not on the posts.  It was incredibly difficult to push the backs onto the posts which ultimately ended up bending the posts a little.  I was able to easily bend them back.  They are small and perfect for a second hole.  Besides the earring back concern, I'd recommend these to others.  Please note that I received this product at a discounted price to provide my honest feedback of it.
END
This is a beautiful necklace , The picture does not do it any justice. It is flawless.
END
Great socks and gives my sock game the edge and still professional. Fit is great and are great quality.
END
I love it! Very happy!
END
They fit but would fall off as soon as I put them on her. We returned Bc I didn't want to lose them the first time we went out
END
I loved this band. I bought it shortly into my pregnancy to allow me to unbutton my pants and still wear them. At that pount i wore it fokded in half - half under my pants with the tip half folded over the zipper.  Later on in pregnancy I used it opened completely so it covered my bump. It felt nice to have that support.  This product never rolled up, which I can imagine would be very frustrating. The material seems to be great quality and held up well throughout my entire pregnancy.
END
This batch of readers is better quality than the last batch I ordered. They do the job-
END
love it!!!
END
Nothing like the picture!!!!
END
super cute long but we use them as anklets totally happy with them!
END
ok
END
love this - just what I was looking for! Nice fabric, great color, fast shipping! I will be ordering more in the spring - thank you!
END
love it!
END
I ordered burnt orange, but I received coral.  The coral is beautiful, so I kept the item.
END
I was so happy the sun was out today.  I love the way these fit.  Sometimes this style makes me look like a big fly but these fit my face so nicely.  I would order again for sure.
END
Love these. My husband does too. Great quality, super soft fabric almost like silk. Well made, good stitching. Amazing fit. Has held up well to a dozen cold water washes/ air dried. Waistband holding up too. So far so good.
END
My husband loves these Sperry Top-Siders! They go great with jeans! very comfortable and fit true to size.
END
I love this beautifully tacky ring!
END
Real pretty, looks just like the picture and i can make the chain longer if i want to, real happy with the purchase.
END
These dinosaur pajamas are our favorite! They are perfect for wearing all year round because the cotton material is light enough for the summer and the long sleeves and pants are suitable for the winter time. My son loves dinosaurs and the dinosaur design on these are adorable. The pj's fit him well. Overall, these are our favorite pj's to wear now. I will be looking to purchase different designs because I like the fit and overall material of these. Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.
END
I bought this to wear to Oktoberfest.  It is definitely not a high quality or authentic costume, but is great for a one time wear. The shirt that came with it is fine, but I ended up wearing my own that fit better.  No socks come with this costume. The pockets are nice and a decent size. The way you adjust the straps isn't fantastic, and the ends of the straps just kind of hang. I tucked them into the waistband. For the money and the fun, it's absolutely worth it. Just to note, it's made from a velour type of material. Comfortable, but not substantial at all.
END
Fit good
END
Love it!!  Wear it all the time.
END
These for my little head perfectly.  Super stylish
END
*Update 2/7/18 - after less than a couple of months the zipper began to malfunction. I ended up replacing it with a different bag. Granted, I did carry it full time and never switched it out. I still like it and may get another one but I won't carry it daily.  I love carrying a wristlet as my daily bag and this is my new favorite. It fits my phone, keys, lip gloss, cards and cash and it doesn't look or feel stuffed. I use the crossbody strap often too. Probably going to order in more colors!!
END
I really wanted to LOVE this shirt in person like I loved it when I ordered it but it is way too small. I ordered an XL but it fits like a M/L and it is a lot shorter in person. I wanted to wear this with some leggings and skinny jeans but it is not long enough to cover my butt so I can't do that. I did receive this item at a discounted price for my honest review.
END
The earrings and necklace came together in a plastic bag. I have to tell you that if you have a small neck this is an okay necklace for you.  It fit around my neck but was so snug and it is a bib necklace so I felt a bit constricted. I am going to add an attachment to it so it will be loose. If you look at the photo you can clearly see how close it is around the neck piece of the mannequin. I love to wear it but have to make sure it is winter and not hot out. I do love the earrings as well because I feel they can also be worn with other pieces or alone. I do love the detail of this necklace.  It is a good buy if you have a smaller neck. Be prepared :)
END
Well constructed, good material, nice loose fit through the legs and rear. Only wish they were flared more for boots.
END
Very comfortable, sleeves are the perfect length, long enough to cover wrists entirely, my only small complaint would be that the elastic in the lace outer layer starts to fray/pop out and needs to be trimmed down or something, not the best quality.
END
Great shoes. Love them. They are so comfortable, there needs to be no break in. They fit perfectly the first time I wear them.
END
Love these purses!  Perfect gift for toddlers!  Great value for the money.
END
Great bag.  Love it.  My iphone 6plus (in a case) fits inside.
END
I like the style of the purse a lot but it has a funky smell that will not go away :(
END
nice wache
END
The item was delivered today and it is very pretty but it broke within in a few hours of putting it on...
END
I really wanted to like this. I am a petite Asian woman weighing in at about 100 lbs and height of 5 foot 4 inches. I purchased the small at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I figured since I am already quite twiggy, fitting a small wouldn't be a problem at all. I was wrong. Trying them on today was quite uncomfortable. It barely buttons, but not without giving me the oh so sexy muffin top. I barely have any fat and if the pants can find a muffin top, something is not right. I am scared to even wash it for fear it'll shrink even more, but then again, I can't really wear it without making sure I create a nifty extending contraption using a hair tie! If you're going to purchase this, make sure you go up a size. The color matches the photo though.
END
Outstanding quality and gorgeous shine!  Better than silver!
END
It was nice but it was too large.
END
I actually bough this product for real money after doing a bit of research because it seemed to be more or less what I was looking forand it turned out to be just about right. As others have said, it's a tight squeeze, but for my purposes that's okay. I have 3 cards in the center pocket and a couple on the side. They fit well, but its snug. You can stuff some folded up bills in there, but it's a bit awkward, and I don't tend to do that often. The pockets are all lined with a fine metal mesh, however I haven't tested its RFID-blocking abilities yet. The leather seems durable and is attractively finished, and the wallet is very easy to stick in a front pocket - which was my desired outcome. Overall, an attractive product.
END
The chain is cheap and broke as soon as I tried fastening it.
END
I can't say enough about these leggings, they're my absolute favorite!!!!
END
Love it !
END
I should have listened the previous comments. This has an ill shape, stripes do not fit well on shoulder and fall. It looks really bad.
END
High quality earrings.  Very attractive. Received  nice compliments when I wore these.  Thanks to my daughter.
END
The swim suit don't look like the picture at all. It's entirely cut too small!  Would have been alright but the body part is too short!
END
Way too cute love love love them
END
Beautiful dress for the price!
END
Got the cupcake one for a party, I love it! It's so comfy & adorable
END
Beautiful summer dress. This dress fits exactly as pictured. One size fits all, one big sheer round circle of fabric with a removable tie at the waist in matching fabric, with slip sewn into the dress. May be worn with neck tie at the back or front. I love it. Very comfortable and lightweight. I'm 5'4" and the bottom of this dress touches the ground a little, unless worn with heels.
END
Item came quickly and was a nice quality. However there were two issues. I ordered a 3XL (normally I am a XL or size 14 bottom) which fits on the bottom but is WAYYYY to small on top. Top fits like a 36C. The other issue is I ordered burgundy and it came bright red.
END
Perfect coin necklace for my husband's pirate costume.  Chain was too short, but not a problem to replace.  Great quality and price.
END
Waaaay toooo small and fringe was already falling out in the pkg.
END
This is offensive
END
hate it
END
Love this purse, little smaller then expected, but still beautiful and arrived in 3 days, amazing!

Very cozzy warm jacket! Love the product!!

Love! Shirt was a major hit at my bridal shower!

There are lots of things that can be done to keep babies from scratching their faces.  Socks and other things can be used but tend to come off pretty easily.  We have used these in the past and just purchased another pair.  They stay on and are awesome for new babies.  They are some of the best infant gloves I have ever used.  Highly recommended!
END
This is a very nice ring looks real looks great with my engagement ring true to size thanks so much will buy again from this seller.
END
Very poorly stitched. The skull applique is not trimmed and the stitches are uneven.
END
I think the buckle is real, it's gold plated but has Louis Vuitton everywhere on it with no typos or cheap errors like that. The leather IS bi cast leather. It comes with a belt hole puncher tool, because it usually fits for 40, I wear 32 and the tool fixed it in minutes. This is one sexy belt
END
These are perfect for work. Barely noticeable and fit flat against my nose. Bioflex clear nose stud's are great if you cant have your crystal in at work. Easy to put in and take out.
END
Love, love, LOVE!
END
Suit was cute but after one wear the bottoms looked scuffed.
END
Just barely big enough for a bandana. If you have a really big head, this will not fit.
END
Wanted  $200.00 for return an exchange . if you buy  go one size up than you would normaly wear
END
Im 5'6", 125 lbs and I bought a L. Granted, I carry my weight in my bum, but these were still way snug. Ordering an xl next time!  Cute otherwise!
END
Surprised at the quality and fit. This little beauty gets a 10/10 from me!
END
Wife's favorite warmup.
END
Great color and quality, just smaller than advertised.
END
Cheap fabric. Very thin an prone to runs. Much larger than expected. Last time I buy from China
END
Smaller than would like
END
Very pretty color! Nice fit since it is stretchy material. It was slightly large but, because of the material, it worked and could also work on the next size up. Pretty, pretty dress!
END
Wouldn't fit on my Pandora bracket.
END
This bag is cute, but it's a bit big for my personal preference. Also, more pockets on the inside would improve this product greatly. I am not a fan of all my items sitting in a pile at the bottom of the bag. I think the style and pattern are wonderful, though!
END
I love Phoebe's children's clothing! These bright yellow and green pajamas are so cute.  Well made, the material is a perfect weight for spring/autumn or in the air conditioning.  I love the fuzzy alligator, he is a big hit with the little ones. All of it is embroidered, and not just a cheap iron-on.  The seams are all straight and well sewn. The fabric is nice and soft, stretchy and comfortable. The material stayed bright through the wash. They are nice and long, many times pajamas are short or shrink up. Not these.   **I was given the opportunity to try this product at a reduced cost/no cost in exchange for a unbiased review/opinion. That means this is my personal opinion on a product I willingly purchased to try and my honest & true opinion. **
END
I had been looking for this type of necklace for a few months now. With a store that I won't name, I had to send back a necklace I bought 3 times because they couldn't get it right. I began searching for a necklace like this but could not find it. Finally, I found this necklace on Amazon and ordered it. It came way sooner than I expected (which is always a good thing) and felt like a kid on Christmas morning. I opened the package and liked what I saw. I wear it everywhere I go and I am glad that I bought this necklace. I would definitely recommend buying this necklace.
END
It is a good fit and a cute design that covers almost everything tourists associate with Russia. The only thing that shows it was not made in Russia is that vodka is not written in Cyrillic--that  would make it seem authentic.
END
Nice ring, but stones fall out easy
END
Bought it for my daughter as a bday gift, she loves it!!
END
Good looking
END
1 yr old grandson approves!!  Washes very well.
END
Love it!

Ordered this hair clip for my wedding and it was stunning. It is a little heavy but with hair bobby pins it worked out perfectly.
END
Nice products thanks
END
Nice product for the price
END
Beautifull, it's nice like a picture.
END
Perfect hat for my infant! Great shade all the way around her head. Stays secure with the string ties and it looks adorable on her!
END
I absolutely love this.. Great for walking out doing my early morning walks and no make up in my area where I live celebs wouldn't be caught dead without make up ...thanks again
END
the black pair were tighter
END
This was amazing getting more for your money with this dress. I am 5 tall and weigh 125 I ordered a small and had to return it was huge. I reordered in xs and it was perfect!
END
Nice shirt, well made, durable fabric.
END
I love!!!!!!!!!! it I buy it for my shirt  that  I got month ago
END
Fun size fits all!
END
This is the perfect size for a toddler! Get the matching wallet too! Very well made and beautiful colors. Easy Velcro to open and close.
END
This ring is pretty but I think one side of the ring is to thick to wear.
END
Dress was beautiful!!! Very well made just a little difficult to put on by yourself
END
Myn son just loves his new cross pendant
END
Thank you
END
Title says it all.  Product is very over rated.  Strap does hold my watch, but that's about it.  Feels very uncomfortable and cheap.  Less than a week old and the sides are curling up and starting to fray.  Not pleased at all!
END
I usually wear an 18, so I ordered a size 20... I should have ordered larger. I have a bigger butt and hip region and it was laughable how tight they were. I'm going to invest into some shorts that have some spandex or even a little flexibility  to them.
END
My wife LOVES it!
END
It fit as expected
END
Seems nice
END
Well the envelope came quickly, but there was nothing in it.
END
Way wrong size than I expected.
END
Don't  waste your money on this... Over size , very expensive trying to returned.
END
Beautiful piece of costome jewelry.
END
Solid glasses, feel sturdy on your face
END
This shirt was a big hit!  Will come back to order more for friends in the future.
END
Wish it was longer.  If you have a long torso you'll be flashing the Galaxy if you have to pick up a dropped tricorder.  It would be really cool if these companies throw in the coordinating theatrical bloomers to wear under it.  On me it's a butt flap dress.  Fabulous higher quality material.  Neckline could be a bit more open.  Fun and accurate for the most part.
END
fabric collected a lot of lint.  it is very comfortable but..... wouldn't buy again
END
too dark
END
Horrible! These couldn't be more narrow and stiff. I've lost several layers of skin where the shoe meets my skin and.
END
My daughter loves these! They look and feel good and she is comfortable.
END
no  buttons in the collar is kind of weird looking. Every thing else is ok.  I wear a mock turtle neck collar underneath and it is better if it is not too warm.  Made a mistake buying these.
END
This is a cute astronaut helmet for my five old daughter. And if she is not wearing it her stuffed animals are
END
Ordered a size up and it fit just right.
END
nice skirt!
END
Large forme but Very soft and resistant to washing machine, recommended. I already bought many, good quality.
END
Its ugly and looks nothing like the materal
END
Very cute and comfortable, a tad tight on the thighs, but very cute!
END
This was the perfect solution for getting a seamless look under some of my clothes during pregnancy but I only wore it twice before there was a hole in the crotch. It fit fine and it wasn't as if I was doing any crazy activities (not that I could have if I tried at that point!) so I was a bit disappointed in the quality.
END
Great necklace for the price. The gold is very shiny and a bit brass like but you get what you pay for and it looks cute I've gotten compliments on it! For someone who is always losing jewelry this is a great option.
END
Costume seems to be good quality for a Halloween costume. My biggest complaint is that I ordered this a month out and it was supposed to arrive a week before Halloween and ended up arriving a week after instead which was hugely disappointing. ORDER FAR IN ADVANCE!
END
Very stylish, high quality leather, well made. I can't imagine a more premium wallet, which is good considering the price. It was a little larger than I expected. The full portion could fit a passport and other documents, without the take-out portion you could fit a large phone inside. For the full sized portion you will definitely need to carry it in a coat pocket or a small bag. The take-out portion works pretty well as a stand-alone wallet and also looks great, although the magnetic clasps that are supposed to keep it closed are too flimsy. As another reviewer noted, the slots for the cards are initially very snug. It will take maybe a month or more of regular use to break in the leather so cards slide in and out easily. Same is true for folding the take-out portion: if you have more than 2 cards or a lot of cash, it won't fold in half easily right away. But even though I just got this the leather looks good enough that I'm sure with use it will be easier.
END
My hubby loved the shirt!!.:):)
END
Def a booty short. Bought for a 9y/o who dances then heads to volleyball - thought they'd be good item to get by at both activities. Fit as hoped on a slim size 12 girl. But had hoped they would be a bit longer, even though new they were a short short. Thankfully she is not that big, they are slightly loose in leg and cover all her booty, just covers it though.
END
Love these! Had them in my cart for a while and finally decided to order them. Wish I wouldn't have waited. Very cute, comfortable and gets lots if compliments.
END
The shoes were nice but much too big for what the size should be.  Tried to exchange it and now they are out of stock of course!
END
a very serviceable every day causual ring. The stone is nice, the setting more rustic. Its a pretty right hand ring for the weekend.
END
This is so adorable I ordered another one in pink. Fits great, machine washable, we get tons of compliments on it when we go out.
END
Good scarf for the price.
END
All sizes were nice, didn't have an issue with any of them coming apart or breaking. Usually the prongs bend causing the glass to become loose. I haven't had any issues. I'll be buying these again when i need more.
END
When i was looking for a new iphone case, i didn't think one could really make much difference in my phone using experience. A case is to protect the phone and inject a little personality into it. But to my surprise, once i put the case on, I found it actually made a large improvement for me in my enjoyment of using the phone. Buttons feel easier to press and the non-slip texture on the side is perfect for keeping a grip on the phone while not being bulky or cheap feeling. Plus, it looks really inviting.  I used to have a silicone case that looks like a cassette, which worked well and cost $9, so I really wasn't super ready to spend almost $30 on a case, but I am getting well over $30 more enjoyment out of this extremely well made case. Very very happy with this purchase.
END
Order sizes up! My kid is 8 months and I ordered an 18 month size!
END
Very nice ring. My husband loves it & he says its very comfortable!
END
Very satisfactory in all respects.  For a gay man who looks and acts straight, this avoids a lot of awkward conversations about sexual orientation and the existence of a partner.
END
This product came ridiculously small. its also cheap material but thats to be expected...
END
Good quality but the swimsuit is def on the small side. order up
END
By far one of the most comfortable shirts I have owned; great thickness, superior comfort. Was nervous before the purchase however very, very happy with this shirt. Would by so many more of these style/quality shirts if given the opportunity. Company should advertise the high quality of of this shirt
END
I ordered this tank top but recieved a different tank top it was a Men's tank!!!! I ended up giving it to my brother in law!
END
Great
END
Horrible quality, extremely bad stitching. I threw it in the trash right away. I can't believe somebody had the nerve to produce this product for sale. They should be ashamed. 0 stars but the review won't allow me to submit without a rating.
END
They look nice especially from the back side. They run small I recommend to order one or two sizes bigger
END
Amazing for the price. Everyone, comments on my curves! This is my second corset..already down a size from my first purchase!  This is a game changer ;)
END
Fits great!
END
perfect
END
I just love every top I've purchased from this brand!! The peplum top is perfect! I ordered 2 sizes larger than I normally wear. I could have gone with the 2X in this top and it would have fit great but I wanted to make sure it was long enough to cover my bottom as I got it to wear with leggings. I am 5' 3" and 230lbs size 42D bra.  I normally wear a 1X sometimes a 2X if the top is a clingy fabric. This top is a thicker material which I love! It hides all my tummy fat! It's super cute!! I'm more modest, the front covers "my girls" totally but the back is more of a deep swoop almost to my bra. I may wear a camisole under it, just for my own comfort. My husband said it was totally tasteful and looked great. The construction of this top is beautifully made! All the stitching is very well crafted! This top will last a long time.  (In my second picture my back is arched trying to capture the full view so the front of the shirt looks like it sticks out more than it actually does.)
END
Larger than I thought it would be.  But it's paisley....so......
END
Love the purse. Just the right size, could had asked for anything better.
END
Great Product!
END
My son loves this hat. He is 5 and it fits him perfectly.
END
We've gotten SO many compliments on this hat! Best of all, my baby can't take it off herself. Great for the sun!
END
came quickly and are super cute.
END
Very happy
END
Received cheaply made shirt with a big black box on the front with two big black ugly "S" lettering.  NOTHING whatsoever like described or shown.  Horrible beyond horrible and definitely not a Simply Southern shirt
END
Beautifully made. Very happy with the quality of this dress. We bought it for my 9 yr old granddaughter to wear in a wedding. Very sweet flow dress.
END
Great price for it and very nice. Some stitching problem, but I fixed that myself before giving it to my woman.
END
These pants fit as expected
END
Don't buy this, it looks nothing like in the picture fabric is cheaper n poorly made,,
END
Nice case! Very happy!
END
These are listed as designer sunglasses. Definitely not designer. The frames are way too wide, will not even stay on my face.
END
I love them, they hold their shape and are very comfortable.
END
Good
END
I'll just have 2 work a lil harder cause it's very cute & not a bad fit
END
I love knee high socks but whats ever better is thigh high socks!  I plan to add this to my Christmas list.
END
Love it I bought it after seeing a sailor moon cosplay with a similar bag.  It's chilled for errands and is even nice enough for a night out. The ears are still a little bent from shipping but they're starting to pop up now. I'd describe it as a medium sized bag; it can fit my makeup bag, full sized body spray, phone and my compact brush. Would recommend if you want a cute purse and if you enjoy sailor moon!!
END
Cheaply made My pendants were all missing
END
Says it is small, they sent 2xl, also they are stir up underpants. Like long johns, but with stir up on the feet. Not at all what I expected.
END
I got this for my boyfriend and he loves it as he has been on the hunt for a carbon fiber wallet for a while now. This is reasonably priced and came out looking really nice. It fits well in his pocket and holds everything. It actually has two long back pockets which is an added bonus. The only downside is that the cover for where the photo ID is usually placed is mesh instead of the clear plastic you usually see. You would have to pull it out when being carded instead of just showing it. Other than that, this wallet is great!
END
I've had problems with some capris that fall down as I work out until I sweat, then they will stay is place. But these capris stay in place right from the start. They are true to size, and I'm very pleased with my purchase.
END
I like the design, but it fit kind of small, and the white is very sheer. I'll end up always wearing it with a cardigan or something.
END
Horrible. That's the best word to describe this hot mess of a shirt. In the pic it is fitted and svelt, but when it arrived, the sleeves were poofy with this weird stitching, the shirt was much too wide and not long enough (and I have a short torso!!), and the collar rolled instead of staying nice, the neck area is way too wide anyway... Just wrong on every level. DON'T waste your money. I didn't even bother to send this mess back. It's a complete, utter waste of time and money, neither of which I care to use in this situation. This merchant should be BANNED from Amazon.  There's no way they think the pic matches their product. They are clearly out to trick as many people as possible and then move on to something else by the time Amazon finds out. Flag these people as fraudsters, Amazon. NOW.
END
I loved it getting other colors!!!
END
I ware a US med. I bought this in XL. It fit perfect. The material is nice and it doesn't wrinkle.

So love this bag it's a must have for every women very good material too and stylish bag
END
Beautiful dress but the zipper is cheaply made! My daughter went to wear it for the first time  on Easter and the zipper broke!!
END
This hat is too cute! The fabric was soft, breathable, and not stiff at all. Perfect add for a hat collection. Or if you're like me, use it for those last minute shopping bad hair days. The adjustable band worked perfectly. Its an adult hat but I was able to adjust it to where my little ones could wear it also. Love the light blue universal color. Makes a great imagination play train engineer hat. Definitely a recommend.  Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes
END
These earing are so beautiful and well made, the stones are clear,good craft and look  like the picture, I love !
END
Gave as a Baby Shower Gift and Mom says it was exactly as she pictured it when she added to her wish list.
END
I love tungsten carbide rings. This ring is nice. Looks like the picture. Great rings for only 20 bucks or so...
END
Nice
END
Love the shades..
END
I love this scarf! I have a thing for skulls and this scarf is perfect. It's warm, nicely made, and very reasonably priced. I also purchased one for my sister because she liked it so much. I get plenty of compliments on it and am very happy I bought it.
END
omgoodness, the cutest bathing suit ever. Its so girly, my toddler tried it on and didn't want to take it off. Its a bit small, but she'll be able to get some wear out of it. It also comes with a hat which was a surprise for me since i thought i was just ordering a top and bottom, but the hat makes this swimming suit oh so adorable. Great buy my baby girl will look amazing all summer long.
END
True to size, perfect fit.
END
bad quality
END
i liked the look when i ordered it but when i got it i was highly unhappy, i didn't like the lenght, it was way too long on me, and it is very heavy when on. if there was a shorter version i would consider, but not this
END
The coolest prettiest watch I have seen. Works amazing and looks wonderful. Will buy more
END
Good packaging, this is exactly what I was expecting.
END
I loved this dress, I used it for lingerie though!
END
Like how these look but had two fall out of my forward helix two different times within a few days of it going in.
END
great socks.  they don't slip whatsoever.
END
I like it, however, it's not as flexible as I thought. Meaning, the opening is very stiff and more narrow than I expected, and can be hard to get things in and out. I had to hang it on a door handle for several days so the straps would stay up and in place.
END
The dress and quality is very nice but runs small.
END
I was so excited to potentially keep my ears warm without having hat head, but back to the drawing board.  The fit is ok, but they easily fall off with any kind of activity.  The inside of the ear mitts are not fleece lined, and therefore not as warm as they should be nor as comfortable.  I would look at other options before investing in the ear mitts.
END
Nice shirt!!
END
Looks good
END
Really cute but Too Small
END
Got it quick, shorts "tight" in the crotch but def worth it to me
END
This is great. I wear with leggings for work and without for play. Very soft material.  I wear it regularly with no issues.
END
excellent
END
With her shoes we got and she looks good. Makes me want to take pictures of her so I can see her in it all the time.
END
Was not a fit I order a size 9 and when it came the main ring was way to small and and the band I order same size and it was to big. The worked with me and I ended up. With a different better ring
END
It's beautiful :D but definitely runs a little bit big! But I love it!
END
Super Soft & stretchy! Very comfortable, the picture for blue shows a little more teal, however its more of a royal blue, it is actually a prettier blue than the picture.
END
These nose rings are just as described and exactly as pictured. They fit easily into my nose piercing. You just have to put it in from the inside of your nostril first.  Full disclosure: I had the opportunity to purchase this set of nose hoops at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review after trial. This opinion is 100% my own and I have no affiliation with the seller of this product.
END
Poor quality
END
It's very nice. However, its a little tight. I usually wear medium but got the extra large and it still hugs my body.
END
This product runs very small. The legs are not nearly as roomy as they appear to be amd are short. NTM shipping took over 1.5 months to arrive.
END
gorgeous, hope it washes well
END
Fits as expected. Beautiful color
END
Fit was good just a bit short but I'm 5 ' 10". Looked good with flats. The belt was a bit cheap looking so I wore a different belt. Got lots of compliments.
END
It is small but i was see the sizes And according for the guide for the sizes, i was to buy this tshirt. I love it..
END
Very good
END
Super cheap material. Doesn't really look like picture
END
Thin material but exactly what I was looking for
END
Cute, cute, cute! Fit is a little tight in the instep and there is not much cushion. I inserted some gel pads and that helped quite a bit. I think with wear, they will stretch a bit. Overall, very satisfied with purchase
END
Simple yet elegant!
END
Beautiful, I love it
END
Great quality and came earlier than expected! Good product.
END
I think they are great.  Fit in my pocket and don't interfere with my hats.
END
This top looks exactly what it should in the picture. The fit is perfect and it's stretchy so it would fit almost anyone. The most appealing feature of this top is its graphics. The colors are bright and eye-catching. The picture of the girl in the front is lovely and remarkable to look at. It fits nicely with tight pants since the top emphasises the look. I am very pleased with this purchase and encourage anyone else who comes across this item. If you're looking for an artsy or stand-out top, this alone says it all.
END
Just the right size for my smaller purses.  Love it !
END
I can't give it four stars due to it being a bit bigger than my 7 3/8 size head.  The hat can on time, in a nice Stetson box and wrapped nicely.  I will keep it and just take some of the foam and size it up with that.  Its a big cowboy hat.  No doubt about that.  It feels very nice and is well made.  This is my second Stetson. My first being a summer straw hat, also very nice.  From a shop in Brooklyn New York.  Go figure.
END
Love them. Fit perfectly. Ordered more in different shades.
END
I ordered white gold and got yellow gold.  They weren't as brilliant as they appear in the picture.  First time I bought diamonds online.  Not sure I would do it again.
END
I like it but it gives me a bad skin reaction whenever I wear it. Whatever the hearts are made of irritates my skin to where I have very red, itchy, little bumps all over my chest for up to a whole week and left behind a few tiny scars which thankfully are fading away now. I love the chokers but please but careful if you have sensitive skin wearing this.
END
Thought it was very good quality for an expensive price.
END
Very good socks play basketball with them will be getting more think they should cost maybe a little less so I can stock up on them
END
Great outfit for a Masquerade Party. Medium was the perfect size. Cape could be used as a magician's cape also. Very pleased.
END
Pretty comfortable to wear but they're cheap quality.
END
Very cute, wish they didn't run so small!
END
Tunic is a thicker material.  Figure flattering and looks great with leggings and boots.
END
Great bling, well made and pretty stoned. Very pleased
END
Item is much larger than what Boughy in the store material feels cheap and generic
END
LOVE LOVE LOVE STILL!!!
END
It was not 6" as described .  It was 10" in length. Had to adapt
END
love love it
END
I love the dress. Feels good on
END
Thanks
END
Too tight not true to size at all. I ordered a xxl and I'm a large, maybe I should've ordered the largest size they have. Very disappointed.
END
I love these boots! I've gotten them for my pole-fitness class, and they look great. If you're going to be wearing them for dancing, expect to stretch the toe box out. I have somewhat wider feet, but the narrowness is alright. If you're going to just get them for a costume/one night thing, then I might recommend going up a size for comfort.
END
EXCELENT
END
Nice style - good fit
END
As a pretty small girl (5'3", ~100 pounds), I expected this to fit - although it's still a bit tight. The main issue for me was the g-string and the garters, which were a bit narrow and hard to get on. I can't figure out the hat, honestly. There's no way to keep it on, although I'm sure with enough bobby pins one could solve that issue. All in all, the product is very cute and extremely sheer, don't expect the panties or the garter to fit if you've got power thighs :)
END
It made me smile when I opened it up. Great ring for a penny. The fit is perfect and it arrived before it's delivery time.
END
This is a cheap material dress. I was thoroughly disappointed. Please don't waste your time. I am glad I didn't buy more.
END
So it looked just like the picture but it was much smaller. I am a small person, I'm 5'1 and typically I have no issues with Asian sizes because of my small frame but this didn't fit like the picture. The sleeves are much thinner, no matter what your size they would not fit like a kimono, they're just not cut like that. The length is fine, a tad shorter than pictures but the sleeves are just totally different. They also sit just past my elbow, so sort of 3/4 sleeve. That all being said it's still cute, the shoulders hit me in the right spot and it fits otherwise, just not as cute as it could have been..
END
I don't know why anyone could have a problem with this skirt! It is awesome! After taking it out of the package I shook it some to fluff it out but the skirt is full and beautiful! I have a two year old and a four year old and they will be able to wear these for a long time. Obviously not something you would wash over and over and over, but I feel okay washing it when it is necessary. Keep it away from velcro and kitty cats with scratch-happy claws. We LOVE it!
END
Was just what I was looking for thank you
END
good
END
This is a fantastic dress. I would feel comfortable wearing it anywhere. The fabric is very classy and the cut is great. Wonderful deal!
END
so many compliments on this dress.
END
Pretty muu muu
END
very strong I work construction and this thing is praticaly bullet proof
END
Very pleased with the sunglasses and service! Owned a pair of these but seem to have lost them so I was glad to find replacements on Amazon!  The first pair I ordered came in a padded envelope and per the description, there was no hard case. As a result, the frame was bent and had pushed one of the lenses out and said lens was cracked as well. I returned this pair and left packaging feedback mentioning that padded envelopes for sunglasses without hard cases was a bad idea and that small boxes would be a safer option. The return and shipment of the second pair was handled quickly and professionally.  The second pair I ordered came in a box with those air cushions and arrived in perfect condition. You may have to (very) gently adjust the nose pads to get them comfortable for your own face but that takes seconds to do. For those that are curious about quality and feel, I would say the frames are fairly sturdy and on par (both quality and price-wise) with sunglasses you could find at Target or similar. They will last a while if you take care of them.
END
I really liked, is beautiful, fresh, perfect size, the perfect length sleeves are beautiful, the beatiful pattern'm really satisfied with the product, it takes a lot of the costs but worth it, I fall in love the product. Excellent, would return to buy them, thanks.
END
I have two of these--beige and burgundy. The fabric is somewhat heavy, which I like (it doesn't fly around) and it fits true to size. I'm 5'1, and I usually wear the skirt on my hips, and it comes to just about 3 inches above my knees. It's much more flattering than I thought it would be, and I'll most likely end up getting more colors!
END
Love it
END
I got the biggest size and it still didn't fit.
END
Love it
END
Very cheap looking runs small
END
Latch broke after 48 hours
END
GREAT PRICE!!!  Mittens fit perfect.
END
The color and size of the sweater are ok but within one single time wearing it, it began to pill up badly.  I've had it for almost two months now and it's just a ginormous sweater of 'pills' which makes it look old and dingy.  Other than that, it's a fine sweater.  I bought a similar sweater from Target 4 years ago and it barely pilled at all.. 4 years it's lasted and is only now  finally getting a little worn out.. this new one will be done after this season based on the way it is weathering already.  Would not buy this again.
END
I had to return. When I opened the box, you could tell that it wasn't the best quality. For instance, you could see a lot of the glue coming out from where the leather meets the sole. It was also a little small. I usually take a 6 and I bought a 6, but I wouldn't be able to wear it with socks.
END
The value is great, considering I got two high quality watch bands for less than the cost one of a lesser quality. I kept the black one for myself and gave the green one to a friend. It's durable, but not too heavy, and feels great.  I'm curious to see how the metal wears over time.  I've had it for a week and there are no wear marks yet. It's easy to remove the watch from the band to wash it or switch between colors if that's your style.
END
Very nice dress for the price. it would be good for  prom, especially if it's not your prom. The top lace part is see through, and the embellishments are similar to the photos
END
Great fit feel so soft
END
My son loves it so much.
END
Not great, cheap look and feel....
END
These are OK, not made for high intensity exercising (*if you are a bit top heavy) but these are great to wear for walking, weight training, floor exercises etc.
END
Not too much to say other than the fact I did return the product to Amazon.
END
Too small, I'd buy a size up. I bought "US Medium", which fits me most of the time, and this shirt is tight in the shoulders and I can't button it. I gave it 3 stars cause I'd give it a 5 if it fit half way.
END
I think I can Macguyver it, and fix it, but not sure. It's really small, maybe for a pre-schooler. My 4th grader will be too big for it soon.
END
Very cheap looking. Don't waste your money.
END
Awesome lenses. Make my glasses look just like they did when i first purchased them. Great product.
END
Cute looking shirt,  however the buttons are very flimsy and now I have to always wear an under tank top for fear of flashing a crowd!
END
Perfect staff in my traveling. Thank you very much, Sergey.
END
too tight and small
END
Very nice fit, flattering and stays up.
END
For the price, these are really good.  They seem to be polarized as stated and they definitely reduce glare.  However, they are a bit snug, even though I have a smaller head than most people (a snug fit can be good since they won't fall off as easily, but time will tell if they are comfortable for longer periods of time).  So far I've only worn them for about 20 mins at a time, and they are fine for that amount of time.  I haven't had them long enough to determine if they are comfortable for longer than that yet.  22 Jun 2016:  For the price, these are still good, but I would NOT recommend wearing for very long.  These eventually dig into your head and leave dimples.  It definitely is uncomfortable over time!  For brief use, they are fine, so it just depends on how long you plan to wear these.  For me, I usually use them on the drive home or to work.
END
Runs a little small
END
Too small
END
Lots of space and hangs! Wish the material were made of something nicer.
END
Nice a slim and holds just what you need.
END
As stated in another review of Hawaiian shirts by Alvish. Purchased quite a few for a work promotion, in 3 styles and multiple sizes and colors. This one is the crowd pleaser, very beautiful in person and the envy of quite a few. This medium was only slightly big so after a wash and dry it will fit perfect. My co-worker believed this shirt suited his personality to a T.
END
It was very pretty but very small
END
Nice material and look.  May want to go up a size
END
Husband liked the hat. It was for him.
END
Beautiful and well made. But it is not made for large busted women (I'm a D cup). I normally wear a medium, so that's what I got. It is way to tight around my chest, armpits, and shoulders. And since it has no stretch it will need to be adjusted.  If you have a large bust get this in a size larger than you would.
END
This is a great buy! As a working pregnant woman who did not want to spend crazy amounts of money on maternity suits for such a short period of time, this band allowed me to wear my tailored work pants up until my 8th month. Works great with jeans too. Of course, you have to wear a top that goes down far enough to conceal the band. Works great on the other end of pregnancy too - when you're too small for full-blown maternity pants & jeans, but too big for your skinny jeans...excellent purchase!
END
Delivered a few days late and the tracking number they gave me didn't work. The shirt fits as expected , but the red is hardly a red. Very light in color and reminds me more of orange. Definitely did not look like the picture in terms of color. Sort of a waste of money for it to not be a RED SHIRT.
END
So small, i even went up 2 sizes and its still way to small.
END
love this
END
This dress is not yellow!  It is more like lime green.
END
This is the worst on line product I've ever purchased. It won't link up after more than three hours trying. Skip this product and by cheaper and simpler product.
END
My 12 year old son ordered this for his 7th grade football team's helmet that is provided by the school.  It attached perfectly, and my son was very happy.  He did have to return another one that had a green tint to it because it wasn't the right size.  This one was the correct size however.  He is 12 yrs old, and 90lbs.
END
very good
END
These sets are so sexy. I got grey and yellow. They fit me pretty well but the band was a little loose. But thats my fault, i shouldve got a smaller size. Im 5'4 128lbs and i got a medium. The material is really good and its not see through. That was my concern. I cant wait to wear these on my vaca next week!
END
Runs a little small. I recommend going up a size.
END
Arrived super early!! Nice big face watch!!
END
Item as described and prompt delivery.
END
Didn't even realize that that she was making noise of light sabers clashing and a millennium falcon taking off these are so awesome and actually really comfortable to wear I love them doesn't even come close
END
Super cute love them
END
Too too funny... Great footsie for every guy who thinks he's super :)
END
Nice shirt and wonderful fabric quality. I would buy again from this seller.
END
They are ok quality for the price but they were way too long. I had to pull them up high in order for them to hit my thighs right.
END
I am very pleased with this T-shirt.  Arrived just in time for school
END
But very beautiful I ended up giving an extra large to my 14 year old daughter who is very slim an American small.
END
Fit great.
END
excellent, discrete small wallet.  front pocket fine.  looks good too.
END
Very very small, I'm xxs size, so I ordered size M, and it is very small, mainly in the bobs
END
Plastic is really tough and inflexible.  My wife got bad rashes from this by just trying it for a day.
END
The dress itself is decent, especially for the price. If it had fit I definitely would have been very pleased. Unfortunately the sizing is ridiculously off. I normally wear a 4-6 and ordered the Medium (8-10) since most reviews warned that it runs small. I figured even if it were loose that'd be fine bc that kind of goes with the flapper style anyway. I could barely get it past my chest and the hips were not gonna happen. Honestly, I'm not that curvy so this was a shock. Sadly, I had to return. I wish they had more accurate sizing bc now I'm too hesitant to buy any of the California Costumes items.
END
Love this.  Just wish I had bigger boobs....
END
Great product!  Got lots of compliments on Pi Day!!  ;)
END
So adorable!!!!!! Exactly as pictured
END
Bought this as a gift for my daughter.  She loves it!
END
I really liked it, its soft and well made. It fit and feels great
END
Nice  very cute
END
Great
END
I am SO super excited to have purchased this dress. Washes well, however, I did not ruinit through the dryer. It looks amazing with brown wedges. Fabric is a bit see-through, but gorgeous. The next dress I buy will be a size smaller.
END
Excellent waist trainer, but after a month of wear one of the rods snapped. Could still wear it but begins to poke and hurt quickly. It does an excellent job though.
END
Nice... small through shoulders for me. Still female last time I checked, and I don't even lift.
END
Looks nothing like picture cheap material and a black mark on it very dissatisfied will never but from here ever again
END
This works well, it holds lots of earrings. The nice thing is you can see them all for easy selection - no more rummaging in a jewelry box.
END
Great pants.  Soft, light-weight, comfortable, and can pass for the real deal.
END
I normally wear a 2X but got a 3X for extra comfort but it is very snug still
END
Too small for the average american i gave this as a present to a 18 year old friends son that needed a nice coat . I did ORIGINALLY ORDER THIS FOR ME BUT ITS MADE FOR ORIENTAL OR SMALLER STATUE TYPE PERSONS .
END
Fits well, well made and so far, no shrinking! A huge plus in our house!!! Will buy Phoebe Cat brand again!
END
The XS/S fit much snigger than I thought it would be but the S/M is too big. Other than the size they are great hats and durable.
END
I'm a 5'8, 250 lb female (dress size 18) and this is awesome. I ordered the 2x and it is a loose fit but that's what I prefer. The feet are much larger than my women's size 9 1/2 however, so if you have really small feet, prepare to zip off the footies or sew them up. The material is kind of acrylic fleece-y but feels very soft and is quite warm. The white on it is satiny and soft as well. I'm very happy with this purchase and can't wait for the Doctor to invite me along!
END
Great socks my friend loved them.
END
Great buy greater purchase
END
Love the fit of this shirt.
END
Beautiful shirt but fits just a little snug for a med
END
The material feels cheap. It's mostly nylon, so it sort of feels like wearing a very loose, very thick pair of pantyhose. My bump isn't very big yet, so i have to keep pulling these up. "One size" for these pants is more like a Medium to Large. Maybe they'll fit/feel better once I'm bigger.
END
Nice everyday top for hanging around the house.  I like these because they aren't too long - nice length.
END
This is a beautiful watch that keeps perfect time. It has a classic look and can be worn for both business and casual occasions. I returned my original shipment, thinking that it was defective. The second shipment had the same problem, and, after reading the material that came with the watch, I realized that the eco drive takes approximately two days to fully charge. Once charged the watch runs forever. Great product at a great price.
END
Very nice quality, and weight for the price. Great large scale statement piece! I wear it often, and get lots of compliments.
END
Love this hat!!  I bought the whole 2 piece bathing suit that matches it.  So far this is the only hat I have found that will stay on my baby's head and she does not try to yank off (at least right away).  There is a string that ties under the chin and the brim flares out farther than most hats I have seen.  We take this hat everywhere with us and it has really been a lifesaver on those harsh sunny days.  nothing worse than a scalp/face/shoulder burn!  This covers everything!
END
Excelente
END
For the money, this belt is pretty decent. It fits well, its not uncomfortable and it appears to be decent leather. I've worn it for a few weeks now and I'm not noticing much wear on the belt itself.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.
END
Comfy !
END
You can't go wrong with classic vans.  They are true to size and super comfortable.  I also enjoy the high tops.
END
I love my pink ceramic ring! Very simple but pretty! Was delivered on time. Very happy.
END
I bought these hats for my mom and I. We both love them. They are warm and look so cute on!
END
I love this shirt it is very fun and fits well and can be worn many different ways!
END
The neckline is not cut to be off shoulder which after talking to others who also purchased seems to be a hit or miss thing . It wasn't as flowy on me just kind of blah but I will make it work
END
Absolutely beautiful on and came as expected. When I was lacing the back up one of the hooks ripped. Maybe needs some work constructing it.
END
It Covers My Face Lol
END
Beautiful jumpsuit but had a whole in it and way too big. I ordered a ex large size 160
END
Not fit to small
END
Very nice dress inlove it
END
Beautiful Infinity & Cross Necklace. I purchased for my daughters. *simple, fun & elegant design. *perfect for any occasion. * can be worn by ladies & girls of all ages. *Inexpensive  and great quality for the price. * Perfect for gift giving, or treating yourself. *Lightweight chain, not to heavy or bulky just right. * Chain measures about 20 inches. Overall I'm very satisfied with it. It exceeded all of my expectations. I will probably buy a few more for gift giving Christmas.
END
The neckline is too big for conventional t shirts
END
fine quality but I wear a small at victoria secrets and a small in there were WAY to small! I returned and got a large.
END
This costume is uncomfortable on account of how offensive and terrible you'd have to be to wear this. Cultures aren't costumes. Don't.
END
I expected to have to buy large due to other ratings and it fit just perfectly.  I'm a size 4 and bought a Large.
END
Size didn't fit right.
END
does not stick, once i placed it on it started to come off and i had not even put on my dress. It came on time however the package was open.
END
A little small, some printing was not done too well
END
Love this dress! So super cute and very warm (I get cold very easily). I got a size bigger because apparently it runs small but I actually should have bought an extra small or something (I'm pretty tiny). Color is true to the picture.
END
It disappointed me
END
Item was much smaller than expected.  Will have to wait to lose weight before I can wear it.
END
Absolutely adorable dress. Fit me really well in the body but wayyy too short. I'm 5'10 and 155lbs. My lady bits were literally hanging out!!! Total bummer. I ordered a medium, going to try a large. Hopefully it'll long enough in the crotch  Update: I ended up ordering the large, much looser of a fit which I didn't mind but again it was way too short in the crotch. I wore it out in Vegas, because Vegas, but I was tugging at it all night long and I guarantee I accidentally flashed a few people. Really unfortunate because I love the dress, the top part didn't bother me as other reviews had said, it fits on the top exactly as you would expect it to, it's just slit right in the crotch and if you have any hips at all it just spreads the slit :/ pretty crappy
END
Giving this a 2 star rating because it is very cute and the fabric is nice, the shipping was a lot faster than expected, but it is way to short in the torso and there is no support for the girls. As far as the shortness goes, I'm 5'1" and I got the XL and it was still to short and because of the it also affected (what littlethere is) the support for the girls. So basically is your very tiny, short, and not so well endowed in the chest, it would probably fit you.
END
Fit is true to size and easy to use right out of the box. Very good performance so far!
END
Runs small. I do like the material and look.
END
amazing. exactly what i was looking for.  crop top. super big tee -tied.  flats.heels. its all looks good.  drops a few inches above my ankle. perfect length.
END
I'm assuming this is the same product Amazon featured a week or so ago as a 'Gold Box' promotion. Anyway, they appear similar. These are junk. Tiny junk. The stones are miniscule. No woman older than six years, will be happy with them. Photos on the website are deceptive. The backing is actually larger than the teeny-weeny stones. I ordered these as a gift, but I'd be embarrassed to give them to anyone. Back they go to Amazon. Too bad they can't just be ground up in the Disposal, but they'd probably sift right through.
END
It's a great looking watch. None of that you get what you pay for. I have purchased many Pocket watches and most of the time price doesn't play a very big role in it. You know what you are spending, and you do it any way. I have always received supper customer support when anything isn't right, to include replacements. This one from Mudder is one of the best I purchased and Mudder will stand behind what they sell. It's as simple as an e-mail. You will get a lot of looks if you carry this one around with you. It's as nice inside as outside.
END
As described..very light weight bag.. i like it
END
Nice product, fast delivery!
END
Perfect
END
Bought this shirt with the assumption that all Chinese clothes run a bit small but I purchased the size I wear here in USA (Large) and it fits nicely. I have 36D's so some side boobage prevails but nothing I can't just tuck into the front. The shirt is shorter on my torso than I imagined and fits more like a swimsuit (length wise) than a crop halter. I love that the shirt actually gives my breast a nice lift, especially since a bra is not an option with this top. The fabric is pretty decent and no complaints about the stitching. The pattern is even nicer in person than in picture.
END
Ordered same size as I always get.  They just feel alittle tight.
END
A humdinger

This bag is so cute! Although the magnet to close the bag could be improved on. I could fit my regular iphone 6 in it along with some money. Its great for short outings to a friends house. Not something you can wear everyday unless you only carry money, a phone smaller than the regular iphone 6 or the same size and maybe some makeup stuff. I still love it though!

This beanie is super cute, comfy, warm and it's sewn or knitted very well. It's great quality, the colors are true to the picture. It fit my 12lbs baby too big. I bought this hat so she could wear it in photos so I took it in from the back and sewed it with white thread. If your daughter is small like mine (6 months, 12lbs, 23inches) it's probably too big. But I can't wait for her to fit into it!
END
This item worked PERFECTLY! I bought a set so I didn't have to wait for each boot to stretch. I used them to stretch THIGH HIGH Frye boots. So, high boots work.
END
box was empty, were is my ring? nothing to return. want my money back!
END
Somewhat small in the bust.
END
These are the most amazing nippies! I have been used them about 10 times in the last month and a half and they work really well. Even as I dance and sweat for hours they never fall off. I would definitely buy a second pair. It is important to clean them immediately after each use and put the plastic back on them. I was a bit insecure about these, but these have saved my life with multiple outfits.
END
Love it!  The neckline is deceptive because it's not a wide neck at all.  It fits small around the neck.
END
Awesome shirt! My daughter wore it to school on her Sweet 16! :)
END
The material is of very good quality recommend this product and the store that sells, be proud to wear a belt with these characteristics
END
Adorable
END
Cute, trendy necklace.  I like the look of this necklace.
END
These are great.  The fit is perfect and the fabric is smooth and nice.  They help keep my son warm at his outdoor preschool.  Really nice.
END
Shipping was really fast, got here when it said it would. The wig is a lot thicker then I thought it would be an that's pretty fantastic, who doesn't like full lushious lock? I think I'm going to need to find a product to help the hair stay together so it doesn't have the little frizz it has, but it's not even anything that's unmanageable. I would definitely recommend I'm in love with it.
END
I really like the way they fit. They are very comfortable.
END
Good fit...nice protection from sun.
END
I love this dress and apparently so did my granddaughter, she took it. lol
END
Beautifull am happy. Thanks

This is the second of these hats I've bought - had one for my first daughter and loved it but lost it somewhere along the line. Bought this one for my newborn and it provides great coverage for her little head and face when we're out for walks. The color is beautiful and the ties make it ever-adjustable for her growing head.
END
Very beautiful dress
END
The set was very adorable upon opening but once I put it on my baby & tried to capture pictures I then realized how poorly made it was. The string from the headband began unraveling as well as her top so needless to say me capturing a baby mermaid didn't workout.
END
good
END
Absolutely in LOVE with these leggings. They are true to size, the perfect thickness, not see-through, flattering, and are VERY comfortable. I would definitely compare these to leggings that you would get at VS/Pink for $50+, and I honestly feel that these are even more comfortable than those. Plus, you can't beat the price of these!  I now have the royal blue color (very bright and fun) and the black pair, but I will be buying many more in the future!
END
Doesn't fit, or look like the picture. Material is super cheap and itchy just when trying on. Didn't return it because I didn't want to go through the hassle.
END
it's OK
END
Seems super cheap and not true to size
END
Ring broken when I took it out the pack
END
I have long curly hair and a smaller than average head.  I used this to keep my hair out of my eyes while I am working (outside worker).  These are thin enough for summers in coastal NC.  Fits perfect, very light so not hot. Just the thing I needed.  This is the second one I bought and will buy more. Good Job guys
END
The style is adorable. However, 3 of the 5 buttons fell off on my FIRST day of wearing it! THREE/FIVE buttons!! The only thing that was keeping my bra and chest area from showing were the middle two buttons. I was so embarrassed.  It's a cute shirt, but really flimsy and cheap.  Lucky it's a nice looking shirt, otherwise I would've just tossed it in the trash.  So now more work for me to sew on the buttons...
END
All good...
END
I like these earrings so much that I bought a second pair :) I get tons of compliments when I wear them. My only complaint is that the metal edges are quite sharp, so they are not comfortable to wear when lying down.
END
I bought these to wear on occasion and now I can't take them off. I love them and so do my friends.
END
Nice light weight item for trips, to be able to pack away flat. Very happy with the item.
END
Cute but WAY too big for me.  They wouldn't stay up at all.  I ended up going with the tights instead.
END
Just sized small
END
They're very comfortable but they're a little loose fitting towards the bottom.
END
3 stars.  I ordered too small.
END
Loved the look, bling, & quality; gave as a gift and will be getting one for myself as well.
END
Needed some costume jewelry for a retro themed Hollywood glam even and this fit the bill and a deep discount!
END
Love it
